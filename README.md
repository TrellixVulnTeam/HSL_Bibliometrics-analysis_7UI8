# HSL_Bibliometrics-analysis
This is a repo for working pipelines of bibliometics analysis at Health Science Library at UNC-Chapel Hill. 
It currently includes a tutorial for PubMed API to access Entrez databases and python code samples for regular bibliometric data processing. 


1. Tutorial for PubMed API to retrieve publication records
    1. Use of Entrez, check [entrez.ipynb](https://github.com/littlethumb123/HSL_Bibliometrics-analysis/blob/master/Entrez_Tutorial/entrez.ipynb)
    2. Use of Entrezpy
2. Project cases
    1. Detect usage of R in resarch, check [code](https://github.com/littlethumb123/HSL_Bibliometrics-analysis/blob/master/Project_Cases/detectR.py), [video](https://youtu.be/_DjLQlS8HqA).  
    2. Parse the affiliation information into predefined categories, check [code](https://github.com/littlethumb123/HSL_Bibliometrics-analysis/blob/master/Project_Cases/parseAffil.py), [video](https://youtu.be/lJReKNft8v0)
    3. Find publications with missing affiliation, check [detectAffil.py](https://github.com/littlethumb123/HSL_Bibliometrics-analysis/blob/master/Project_Cases/detectAffil.py). This tool is currently developed and aims to 
    check the missing records from other databases than PubMed.
