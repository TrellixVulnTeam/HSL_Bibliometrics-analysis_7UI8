TI  - AAV-mediated expression of HLA-G1/5 reduces severity of experimental autoimmune
      uveitis.
LID - 19864
AB  - Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is an intractable, recurrent, and painful disease
      that is a common cause of vision loss. Available treatments of NIU, such as the
      use of topical corticosteroids, are non-specific and have serious side effects
      which limits them to short-term use; however, NIU requires long-term treatment to
      prevent vision loss. Therefore, a single dose therapeutic that mediates long-term
      immunosuppression with minimal side effects is desirable. In order to develop an 
      effective long-term therapy for NIU, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy
      approach was used to exploit a natural immune tolerance mechanism induced by the 
      human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G). To mimic the prevention of NIU, naïve Lewis
      rats received a single intravitreal injection of AAV particles harboring
      codon-optimized cDNAs encoding HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 isoforms one week prior to the
      induction of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). AAV-mediated expression of
      the HLA-G-1 and -5 transgenes in the targeted ocular tissues following a single
      intravitreal injection of AAV-HLA-G1/5 significantly decreased clinical and
      histopathological inflammation scores compared to untreated EAU eyes (p < 0.04). 
      Thus, localized ocular gene delivery of AAV-HLA-G1/5 may reduce the off-target
      risks and establish a long-term immunosuppressive effect that would serve as an
      effective and novel therapeutic strategy for NIU, with the potential for
      applications to additional ocular immune-mediated diseases.

TI  - Computing and graphing probability values of pearson distributions: a SAS/IML
      macro.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Any empirical data can be approximated to one of Pearson
      distributions using the first four moments of the data (Elderton WP, Johnson NL. 
      Systems of Frequency Curves. 1969; Pearson K. Philos Trans R Soc Lond Ser A.
      186:343–414 1895; Solomon H, Stephens MA. J Am Stat Assoc. 73(361):153–60 1978). 
      Thus, Pearson distributions made statistical analysis possible for data with
      unknown distributions. There are both extant, old-fashioned in-print tables
      (Pearson ES, Hartley HO. Biometrika Tables for Statisticians, vol. II. 1972) and 
      contemporary computer programs (Amos DE, Daniel SL. Tables of percentage points
      of standardized pearson distributions. 1971; Bouver H, Bargmann RE. Tables of the
      standardized percentage points of the pearson system of curves in terms of β1 and
      β2. 1974; Bowman KO, Shenton LR. Biometrika. 66(1):147–51 1979; Davis CS,
      Stephens MA. Appl Stat. 32(3):322–7 1983; Pan W. J Stat Softw. 31(Code Snippet
      2):1–6 2009) available for obtaining percentage points of Pearson distributions
      corresponding to certain pre-specified percentages (or probability values; e.g., 
      1.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, etc.), but they are little useful in statistical analysis
      because we have to rely on unwieldy second difference interpolation to calculate 
      a probability value of a Pearson distribution corresponding to a given percentage
      point, such as an observed test statistic in hypothesis testing. Results: The
      present study develops a SAS/IML macro program to identify the appropriate type
      of Pearson distribution based on either input of dataset or the values of four
      moments and then compute and graph probability values of Pearson distributions
      for any given percentage points. Conclusions: The SAS macro program returns
      accurate approximations to Pearson distributions and can efficiently facilitate
      researchers to conduct statistical analysis on data with unknown distributions.

TI  - Immune gene expression profiling reveals heterogeneity in luminal breast tumors.
LID - 147
AB  - Background: Heterogeneity of immune gene expression patterns of luminal breast
      cancer (BC), which is clinically heterogeneous and overall considered as low
      immunogenic, has not been well studied especially in non-European populations.
      Here, we aimed at characterizing the immune gene expression profile of luminal BC
      in an Asian population and associating it with patient characteristics and tumor 
      genomic features. Methods: We performed immune gene expression profiling of tumor
      and adjacent normal tissue in 92 luminal BC patients from Hong Kong using
      RNA-sequencing data and used unsupervised consensus clustering to stratify
      tumors. We then used luminal patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA,
      N = 564) and a Korean breast cancer study (KBC, N = 112) as replication datasets.
      Results: Based on the expression of 130 immune-related genes, luminal tumors were
      stratified into three distinct immune subtypes. Tumors in one subtype showed
      higher level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), characterized by T cell
      gene activation, higher expression of immune checkpoint genes, higher
      nonsynonymous mutation burden, and higher APOBEC-signature mutations, compared
      with other luminal tumors. The high-TIL subtype was also associated with lower
      ESR1/ESR2 expression ratio and increasing body mass index. The comparison of the 
      immune profile in tumor and matched normal tissue suggested a tumor-derived
      activation of specific immune responses, which was only seen in high-TIL
      patients. Tumors in a second subtype were characterized by increased expression
      of interferon-stimulated genes and enrichment for TP53 somatic mutations. The
      presence of three immune subtypes within luminal BC was replicated in TCGA and
      KBC, although the pattern was more similar in Asian populations. The germline
      APOBEC3B deletion polymorphism, which is prevalent in East Asian populations and 
      was previously linked to immune activation, was not associated with immune
      subtypes in our study. This result does not support the hypothesis that the
      germline APOBEC3B deletion polymorphism is the driving force for immune
      activation in breast tumors in Asian populations. Conclusion: Our findings
      suggest that immune gene expression and associated genomic features could be
      useful to further stratify luminal BC beyond the current luminal A/B
      classification and a subset of luminal BC patients may benefit from checkpoint
      immunotherapy, at least in Asian populations.

TI  - Understanding the intersection of race and place: the case of tuberculosis in
      Michigan.
LID - 1669
AB  - Background: Race and place intersect to produce location-based variation in
      disease distributions. We analyzed the geographic distribution of tuberculosis
      (TB) incidence in Michigan, USA to better understand the complex interplay
      between race and place, comparing patterns in Detroit, Wayne County and the state
      of Michigan as a whole. Methods: Using cross-sectional TB surveillance data from 
      the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, multivariable statistical
      models were developed to analyze the residence patterns of TB incidence from 2007
      through 2012. Two-way interactions among the residence location and race of cases
      were assessed. Results: Overall, Detroit residents experienced 58% greater TB
      incidence than residents of Wayne County or the state of Michigan. Racial
      inequalities were less pronounced in Detroit compared to both Wayne County and
      the state of Michigan. Blacks in Detroit had 2.01 times greater TB incidence than
      Whites, while this inequality was 3.62 times more in Wayne County and 8.72
      greater in the state of Michigan. Conclusion: Our results highlight how race and 
      place interact to influence patterns of TB disease, and the ways in which this
      interaction is context dependent. TB elimination in the U.S. will require
      strategies that address the local social environment, as much as the physical
      environment.

TI  - The impact of basic vs. enhanced Go NAPSACC on child care centers’ healthy eating
      and physical activity practices: protocol for a type 3 hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized trial.
LID - 101
AB  - Background: To prevent childhood obesity and promote healthy development, health 
      authorities recommend that child care programs use the evidence-based practices
      that foster healthy eating and physical habits in children. Go NAPSACC is an
      intervention shown to improve use of these recommended practices, but it is known
      to encounter barriers that limit its impact and widespread use. Methods: This
      study will use a type 3 hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized
      trial to compare effectiveness and implementation outcomes achieved from Go
      NAPSACC delivered with a basic or enhanced implementation approach. Participants 
      will include approximately 25 coaches from Child Care Aware of Kentucky (serving 
      four geographic regions), 97 child care centers with a director and teacher from 
      each and two cross-sectional samples of 485 3–4-year-old children (one
      recruitment at baseline, another at follow-up). Coaches will be randomly assigned
      to deliver Go NAPSACC using either the basic or enhanced implementation approach.
      “Basic Go NAPSACC” represents the traditional way of delivering Go NAPSACC.
      “Enhanced Go NAPSACC” incorporates preparatory and support activities before and 
      during their Go NAPSACC work, which are guided by the Quality Implementation
      Framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Data will
      be collected primarily at baseline and post-intervention, with select measures
      continuing through 6, 12, and 24 months post-intervention. Guided largely by
      RE-AIM, outcomes will assess change in centers’ use of evidence-based nutrition
      and physical activity practices (primary, measured via observation); centers’
      adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the Go NAPSACC program (assessed via
      website use); center directors’, teachers’, and coaches’ perceptions of
      contextual factors (assessed via self-report surveys); children’s eating and
      physical activity behaviors at child care (measured via observation and
      accelerometers); and cost-effectiveness (assessed via logs and expense tracking).
      The hypotheses anticipate that “Enhanced Go NAPSACC” will have greater effects
      than “Basic Go NAPSACC.” Discussion: This study incorporates many lessons gleaned
      from the growing implementation science field, but also offers opportunities to
      address the field’s research priorities, including applying a systematic method
      to tailor implementation strategies, examining the processes and mechanisms
      through which implementation strategies produce their effects, and conducting an 
      economic evaluation of implementation strategies. Trial Registration:

TI  - Allogeneic transplantation in elderly patients ≥65 years with non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma: a time-trend analysis.
LID - 97
AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative therapy
      for relapsed/refractory and high-risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, no
      large studies have evaluated allo-HCT utilization in elderly NHL patients (≥65
      years). Using the CIBMTR registry, we report a time-trend analysis of 727 NHL
      patients (≥65 years) undergoing the first allo-HCT from 2000 to 2015 in the
      United States (US). Study cohorts were divided by time period: 2000–2005 (N = 76)
      vs. 2006–2010 (N = 238) vs. 2011–2015 (N = 413). Primary outcome was overall
      survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS),
      relapse/progression (R/P), and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Median age at
      transplant, use of reduced-intensity conditioning, and graft source remained
      stable, while use of unrelated donors increased in the most current era. The
      1-year probabilities of NRM from 2000 to 2005 vs. 2006–2010 vs. 2011–2015 were
      24% vs. 19% vs. 21%, respectively (p = 0.67). Four-year probability of R/P was
      similar among the three cohorts: 48% (2000–2005), 40% (2006–2010), and 40%
      (2011–2015) (p = 0.39). The 4-year probabilities of PFS and OS (2000–2005 vs.
      2006–2010 vs. 2011–2015) showed significantly improved outcomes in more recent
      time periods: 17% vs. 31% vs. 30% (p = 0.02) and 21% vs. 42% vs. 44% (p < 0.001),
      respectively. Utilization of allo-HCT increased in elderly NHL patients in the US
      since 2000 with improving survival outcomes.

TI  - Stigma and mobile app use among young black men who have sex with men.
PG  - 523-37
AB  - INTRODUCTION:: Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are
      disproportionately affected by HIV. Intersectional stigmas are associated with
      increased HIV vulnerability, and worse outcomes for YBMSM with HIV. YBMSM find
      sex partners via sexual networking apps, but stigma on apps has been poorly
      studied. METHODS:: We conducted cross-sectional analysis of 324 YBMSM seeking sex
      partners via apps to assess stigma experiences in eight dimensions compared to
      non-users (N=150). We conducted detailed stratified analyses to identify granular
      stigma data. RESULTS:: App users had higher median scores than non-users in
      perceived HIV discrimination, perceived HIV stigma, experienced sexual minority
      stigma, racial discrimination, and perceived homophobia. DISCUSSION:: We
      demonstrate higher levels of intersectional stigmas among app users than
      non-users, but did not find an overall increase in stigma with increasing app
      use. Considering the prominent role of apps in YBMSM sexual networking,
      interventions that reduce stigma on apps are needed.

TI  - Physical activity calorie expenditure (PACE) labels in worksite cafeterias:
      effects on physical activity.
LID - 1596
AB  - Background: Regular physical activity is an important component of healthy living
      and wellbeing. Current guidelines recommend that adults participate in at least
      150 min of moderate or vigorous-intensity physical activity weekly. In spite of
      the benefits, just over half of U.S. adults meet these recommendations.
      Calorie-only food labels at points of food purchase have had limited success in
      motivating people to change eating behaviors and increase physical activity. One 
      new point of purchase approach to promote healthy behaviors is the addition of
      food labels that display the physical activity requirement needed to burn the
      calories in a food item (e.g. walk 15 min). Methods: The Physical Activity
      Calorie Expenditure (PACE) Study compared activity-based calorie-expenditure food
      labels with calorie-only labels at three Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North
      Carolina worksite cafeterias. After 1 year of baseline data collection, one
      cafeteria had food items labeled with PACE labels, two others had calorie-only
      food labels. Cohort participants were asked to wear an accelerometer and complete
      a self-report activity questionnaire on two occasions during the baseline year
      and twice during the intervention year. Results: A total of 366 study
      participants were included in the analysis. In the PACE-label group,
      self-reported physical activity increased by 13–26% compared to the calorie-only 
      label group. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) increased by 24 min
      per week in the PACE-label group compared to the calorie-label group (p = 0.06). 
      Changes in accelerometer measured steps, sedentary time, and MVPA had modest
      increases. Change ranged from 1 to 12% with effect size values from 0.08 to 0.15.
      Baseline physical activity level significantly moderated the intervention effects
      for all physical activity outcomes. Participants in both label groups starting in
      the lowest tertile of activity saw the largest increase in their physical
      activity. Conclusion: Results suggest small positive effects for the PACE labels 
      on self-reported and objective physical activity measures. Minutes of weekly
      MVPA, strength training, and exercise activities showed modest increases. These
      results suggest that calorie-expenditure food labels may result in some limited
      increases in physical activity.

      Hispanics/Latinos: a cross-sectional analysis of the echocardiographic study of
      Latinos.
LID - e028729
AB  - Objective: Hispanics/Latinos, the largest immigrant population in the USA,
      undergo the process of acculturation and have a large burden of heart failure
      risk. Few studies have examined the association of acculturation on cardiac
      structure and function. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: The Echocardiographic
      Study of Latinos. Participants: 1818 Hispanic adult participants with baseline
      echocardiographic assessment and acculturation measured by the Short
      Acculturation Scale, nativity, age at immigration, length of US residence,
      generational status and language. Primary and secondary outcome measures:
      Echocardiographic assessment of left atrial volume index (LAVI), left ventricular
      mass index (LVMI), early diastolic transmitral inflow and mitral annular
      velocities. Results: The study population was predominantly Spanish-speaking and 
      foreign-born with mean residence in the US of 22.7 years, mean age of 56.4 years;
      50% had hypertension, 28% had diabetes and 44% had a body mass index >30 kg/m2.
      Multivariable analyses demonstrated higher LAVI with increasing years of US
      residence. Foreign-born and first-generation participants had higher E/e′ but
      lower LAVI and e′ velocities compared with the second generation. Higher
      acculturation and income >$20K were associated with higher LVMI, LAVI and E/e′
      but lower e′ velocities. Preferential Spanish-speakers with an income <$20K had a
      higher E/e′. Conclusions: Acculturation was associated with abnormal cardiac
      structure and function, with some effect modification by socioeconomic status.

TI  - Minimally invasive laser Doppler flowmetry is suitable for serial bone perfusion 
      measurements in mice.
LID - 100231
AB  - In vivo laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has previously been used to quantify blood 
      perfusion accurately at a single timepoint in the murine tibial metaphysis.
      However, this procedure entailed substantial disruption to soft tissues overlying
      the bone and caused notable localized inflammation for several weeks after the
      procedure, impeding serial measurements in the same mouse. In this study, we
      tested a less invasive technique to measure perfusion in the tibia with LDF and
      determined that it can be used serially in the same mouse without causing signs
      of inflammation or gait perturbations. Twenty 14-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were
      evenly divided into groups that either had daily treadmill exercise or remained
      sedentary. Within these activity groups, mice were evenly subdivided into groups 
      that received LDF measurements either weekly or only once at the study endpoint. 
      Bone perfusion was measured with LDF in the anteromedial region of the right
      tibial metaphysis. Serum concentrations of interleukin 6, incision site wound
      area, and interlimb coordination during gait were measured weekly for four weeks.
      Tibial perfusion did not differ significantly between exercise and sedentary
      groups within the weekly or endpoint-only LDF groups at any timepoint. Perfusion 
      was significantly increased in the third week in the weekly LDF group relative to
      measurements in the second and fourth weeks. Ligation of the femoral artery
      caused consistent, rapid reductions in tibial perfusion, validating that LDF is
      sensitive to changes in tibial blood supply. Weekly LDF procedures did not
      adversely affect gait, as interlimb coordination during treadmill locomotion was 
      similar between weekly and endpoint-only LDF groups at every timepoint. Images of
      the incision site show wound closure within one week, and serum concentrations of
      interleukin 6 were not significantly different between weekly and endpoint-only
      groups. Together, these findings demonstrate that our minimally invasive LDF
      technique is suitable for serial in vivo measurements of intraosseous blood
      perfusion without inducing localized inflammation or negatively affecting gait
      patterns in mice.

TI  - Psychosocial determinants of sustained maternal functional impairment:
      Longitudinal findings from a pregnancy-birth cohort study in rural Pakistan.
LID - e0225163
AB  - Function is an important marker of health throughout the life course, however, in
      low-and-middle-income-countries, little is known about the burden of functional
      impairment as women transition from pregnancy to the first year post-partum.
      Leveraging longitudinal data from 960 women participating in the Share Child
      Cohort in Pakistan, this study sought to (1) characterize functional trajectories
      over time among women in their perinatal period and (2) assess predictors of
      chronic poor functioning following childbirth. We used a group-based trajectory
      modeling approach to examine maternal patterns of function from the third
      trimester of pregnancy through 12 months post-partum. Three trajectory groups
      were found: persistently well-functioning (51% of women), poor functioning with
      recovery (39% of women), and chronically poor functioning (10% of women). When
      compared to mothers in the highest functioning group, psychosocial
      characteristics (e.g., depression, stress, and serious life events) were
      significantly associated with sustained poor functioning one-year following
      child-birth. Mothers living in nuclear households were more likely to experience 
      chronic poor functioning. Higher education independently predicted maternal
      function recovery, even when controlling for psychosocial characteristics.
      Education, above and beyond socio-economic assets, appears to play an important
      protective role in maternal functional trajectories following childbirth. Public 
      health implications related to maternal function and perinatal mental health are 
      discussed.

TI  - A crowdsourced intervention to promote hepatitis B and C testing among men who
      have sex with men in China: A nationwide online randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 64-73
AB  - Background: Crowdsourcing may be an effective strategy to develop test promotion 
      materials. We conducted an online randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a
      crowdsourced intervention to promote hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. Methods: MSM 
      never previously tested for hepatitis were recruited through social media.
      Eligible men were randomized to receive an online crowdsourced intervention or no
      testing promotion materials. Outcomes including self-reported and confirmed HBV
      and HCV test uptake were assessed after four weeks. Odds ratios (OR) with 95%
      confidence intervals (95% CI) of men achieving primary and secondary outcomes
      between the intervention and control arms were calculated. Findings: 556 eligible
      men were enrolled. Overall, 17•4% (97/556) of men self-reported HBV and HCV
      testing and 7•9% (44/556) confirmed HBV and HCV test uptake. The intervention was
      seen by 72•1% and 29•0% of men in the intervention and control arms,
      respectively. In intention-to-treat analysis, confirmed HBV and HCV test uptake
      was similar between the two arms, both when using a missing=failure approach (OR 
      0•98, 95% CI 0•53–1•82) or multiple imputation (OR 1•46, 95% CI 0•72–2•95).
      Interpretation: This RCT extends the literature by developing and evaluating an
      intervention to spur hepatitis testing in a middle-income country with a high
      burden of hepatitis. Overall test uptake among MSM in China was similar to
      previous interventions promoting hepatitis testing in high-income countries. We
      found frequent intervention sharing, complicating interpretation of the results, 
      and the role of crowdsourcing to promote hepatitis testing remains unclear.

TI  - Trends in Food Consumption Patterns of US Infants and Toddlers from Feeding
      Infants and Toddlers Studies (FITS) in 2002, 2008, 2016.
LID - 2807
AB  - The Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) is the largest survey of dietary
      intake among infants and young children in the United States. Dietary patterns in
      early childhood are a key component of prevention of diet-related chronic
      diseases, yet little is known about how food consumption patterns of infants and 
      young children have changed over time. The objective of this study is to examine 
      trends in food and beverage consumption among children ages 6–23.9 months using
      data from the FITS conducted in 2002, 2008, and 2016. A total of 5963 infants and
      young children ages 6–23.9 months were included in these analyses. Food
      consumption data were collected using a multiple-pass 24-h recall by telephone
      using the Nutrition Data System for Research. Linear trends were assessed using
      the Wald’s test in a multivariable linear regression model. Positive significant 
      findings include increases in breast milk consumption and decreases in the
      consumption of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and 100% fruit juice. More
      troubling findings include decreasing infant cereal consumption, stagnant or
      decreasing whole grain consumption, and stagnant consumption of vegetables. Our
      findings suggest some promising improvements in dietary intake among infants and 
      toddlers in the United States over the past 15 years, but further policy,
      programmatic, and industry efforts are still needed.

TI  - Differences in Inpatient Outcomes After Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement at
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) and Non‐TAVR Centers.
LID - e013794
AB  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has solidified the
      importance of a heart team and revolutionized patient selection for surgical
      aortic valve replacement (SAVR). It is unknown if hospital ability to offer TAVR 
      impacts SAVR outcomes. We investigated outcomes after SAVR between TAVR and
      non‐TAVR centers. Methods and Results: Hospitalizations of patients aged
      ≥50 years, undergoing elective SAVR between January 2012 and September 2015, in
      the National Readmission Database (NRD) were included. Multivariable logistic,
      linear, and generalized logistic regression models were used to adjust for
      patient and hospital characteristics and estimate association between undergoing 
      SAVR at a TAVR center, compared with a non‐TAVR center. The association between
      TAVR volumes and these outcomes were also assessed. SAVR hospitalizations (n =
      32 198) were identified; 22 066 (69%) at TAVR and 10 132 (31%) at non‐TAVR
      centers. SAVRs at TAVR centers had lower odds of inpatient mortality (odds ratio 
      0.67, 95% CI 0.55–0.82) and discharge to skilled nursing facility (odds ratio
      0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99), compared with non‐TAVR centers. There was no difference 
      in LOS (change in estimate −0.09, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.08) or 30‐day re‐admission
      (odds ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.88–1.03). SAVRs performed at the highest TAVR volume
      centers had the lowest inpatient mortality, compared with non‐TAVR centers (odds 
      ratio 0.43 95% CI 0.29–0.63). Conclusions: Patients undergoing SAVR at TAVR
      centers are more likely to survive and have better discharge disposition than
      patients undergoing SAVR at non‐TAVR centers. Whether this represents benefits of
      a heart‐team approach to care or differences in patient selection for SAVR when
      TAVR is unavailable requires further study.

TI  - An Eye Tracking Study of Anti-Smoking Messages on Toxic Chemicals in Cigarettes.
LID - 4435
AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration is tasked with communicating information to
      the public about the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke. Our study used eye
      tracking method to test the effectiveness of messages about the harmful chemicals
      in cigarettes smoke among adult smokers. A sample size of 211 current cigarette
      smokers viewed four communication messages that included: Health effects of a
      chemical in cigarette smoke and an image depicting the health effect. The
      messages focused on arsenic, formaldehyde, uranium, and general health. Eye
      tracking recorded the length of time participants viewed the text and the image. 
      After each message, the participants were asked about the messages’ effectiveness
      in changing attitudes towards smoking. We analyzed the data using multilevel
      modeling, and of the 211 smokers, 59.7% were female, 36.5% were Black, and 21.3% 
      had a high school degree or less. Compared to the general message, the messages
      about formaldehyde and uranium were more discouraging to smoking (p < 0.05).
      Messages about formaldehyde were more believable and made participants want to
      quit more than the general messages. Increasing message dose was significantly
      associated with discouraging participants from smoking and made participants want
      to quit (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that anti-smoking messages, containing
      chemical information, can successfully increase negative attitudes toward smoking
      cigarettes and potentially encourage quitting.

TI  - Persistent socioeconomic and racial and ethnic disparities in pathogen burden in 
      the United States, 1999–2014.
LID - e301
AB  - The disproportionate burden of prevalent, persistent pathogens among
      disadvantaged groups may contribute to socioeconomic and racial/ethnic
      disparities in long-term health. We assessed if the social patterning of pathogen
      burden changed over 16 years in a U.S.-representative sample. Data came from 17
      660 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants. Pathogen
      burden was quantified by summing the number of positive serologies for
      cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, HSV-2, human papillomavirus and
      Toxoplasma gondii and dividing by the number of pathogens tested, giving a
      percent-seropositive for each participant. We examined sex- and age-adjusted mean
      pathogen burdens from 1999–2014, stratified by race/ethnicity and SES
      (poverty-to-income ratio (PIR); educational attainment). Those with a PIR < 1.3
      had a mean pathogen burden 1.4–1.8 times those with a PIR > 3.5, with no change
      over time. Educational disparities were even greater and showed some evidence of 
      increasing over time, with the mean pathogen burden among those with less than a 
      high school education approximately twice that of those who completed more than
      high school. Non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American and other Hispanic participants
      had a mean pathogen burden 1.3–1.9 times non-Hispanic Whites. We demonstrate that
      socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in pathogen burden have persisted
      across 16 years, with little evidence that the gap is closing.

TI  - Rapid increase of gonorrhoea cases in Guangdong Province, China, 2014–2017: a
      review of surveillance data.
LID - e031578
AB  - Objectives: An increased trend in the number of reported gonorrhoea cases has
      been observed between 2014 and 2017 in China. This study aims to describe the
      reported epidemic of gonorrhoea and potential driving forces in Guangdong
      Province, China. Design: A review of surveillance data. Participants: Three
      different sources of data from Guangdong Province were analysed: gonorrhoea cases
      reported to the Chinese sexually transmitted infections (STI) case report system 
      (CRS); a clinic-based retrospective study conducted to collect information on
      annual gonorrhoea screening coverage and data from the Guangdong governmental
      sentinel surveillance network (SSN) to examine the gonorrhoea prevalence among
      males attending STI clinics. Outcome measures: Reported incidence of gonorrhoea, 
      number of reported gonorrhoea cases, number of screening tests for gonorrhoea and
      gonorrhoea prevalence. Results: The STI CRS data showed that the reported
      incidence of gonorrhoea has increased rapidly from 15.7 cases per 100 000
      population in 2014 to 27.3 cases per 100 000 in 2017 in Guangdong (p<0.001).
      Regions with a reported incidence of gonorrhoea cases of more than 10 cases per
      100 000 expanded from 7 cities in 2014 to 13 cities in 2017. The SSN data showed 
      that the gonorrhoea prevalence among males attending STI clinics increased from
      2.7% in 2015 to 3.6% in 2017 (p=0.14). The retrospective study showed that the
      increased rate of screening for gonorrhoea between 2014 and 2017 was 35.0%, which
      was much lower than the increased rate of the number of reported gonorrhoea cases
      (123.3%). Conclusions: The number of gonococcal infections is rapidly rising in
      Guangdong, China. Expanded screening coverage, use of more sensitive diagnostics 
      and increase of gonorrhoea prevalence are three potential contributors to the
      epidemic. Additional targeted intervention strategies are necessary in the future
      to control the epidemic.

TI  - Acute Ingestion of a Mixed Flavonoid and Caffeine Supplement Increases Energy
      Expenditure and Fat Oxidation in Adult Women: A Randomized, Crossover Clinical
      Trial.
LID - 2665
AB  - This randomized, double-blinded, crossover study measured the acute effect of
      ingesting a mixed flavonoid-caffeine (MFC) supplement compared to placebo (PL) on
      energy expenditure (EE) and fat oxidation (FATox) in a metabolic chamber with
      premenopausal women (n = 19, mean ± SD, age 30.7 ± 8.0 year, BMI 25.7 ± 3.4
      kg/m2). The MFC supplement (658 mg flavonoids, split dose 8:30, 13:00) contained 
      quercetin, green tea catechins, and anthocyanins from bilberry extract, and 214
      mg caffeine. Participants were measured twice in a metabolic chamber for a day,
      four weeks apart, with outcomes including 22 h EE (8:30–6:30), substrate
      utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), plasma caffeine levels (16:00),
      and genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551. Areas under
      the curve (AUC) for metabolic data from the MFC and PL trials were calculated
      using the trapezoid rule, with a mixed linear model (GLM) used to evaluate the
      overall treatment effect. The 22 h oxygen consumption and EE were significantly
      higher with MFC than PL (1582 ± 143, 1535 ± 154 kcal/day, respectively, p =
      0.003, trial difference of 46.4 ± 57.8 kcal/day). FATox trended higher for MFC
      when evaluated using GLM (99.2 ± 14.0, 92.4 ± 14.4 g/22 h, p = 0.054). Plasma
      caffeine levels were significantly higher in the MFC versus PL trial (5031 ± 289,
      276 ± 323 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.001). Trial differences for 22 h EE and
      plasma caffeine were unrelated after controlling for age and body mass (r =
      −0.249, p = 0.139), and not different for participants with the homozygous allele
      1, A/A, compared to C/A and C/C (p = 0.50 and 0.56, respectively). In conclusion,
      EE was higher for MFC compared to PL, and similar to effects estimated from
      previous trials using caffeine alone. A small effect of the MFC on FATox was
      measured, in contrast to inconsistent findings previously reported for this
      caffeine dose. The trial variance for 22 h EE was not significantly related to
      the variance in plasma caffeine levels or CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and
      non-carriers.

TI  - Involution of Breast Lobules, Mammographic Breast Density and Prognosis Among
      Tamoxifen-Treated Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Patients.
LID - 1868
AB  - Mammographic breast density (MD) reflects breast fibroglandular content. Its
      decline following adjuvant tamoxifen treated, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
      breast cancer has been associated with improved outcomes. Breast cancers arise
      from structures termed lobules, and lower MD is associated with increased
      age-related lobule involution. We assessed whether pre-treatment involution
      influenced associations between MD decline and risk of breast cancer-specific
      death. ER-positive tamoxifen treated patients diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente
      Northwest (1990–2008) were defined as cases who died of breast cancer (n = 54)
      and matched controls (remained alive over similar follow-up; n = 180). Lobule
      involution was assessed by examining terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) in
      benign tissues surrounding cancers as TDLU count/mm2, median span and acini
      count/TDLU. MD (%) was measured in the unaffected breast at baseline (median
      6-months before) and follow-up (median 12-months after tamoxifen initiation).
      TDLU measures and baseline MD were positively associated among controls (p <
      0.05). In multivariable regression models, MD decline (≥10%) was associated with 
      reduced risk of breast cancer-specific death before (odds ratio (OR): 0.41, 95%
      CI: 0.18–0.92) and after (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.18–0.94) adjustment for TDLU
      count/mm2, TDLU span (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14–0.84), and acini count/TDLU (OR:
      0.33, 95% CI: 0.13–0.81). MD decline following adjuvant tamoxifen is associated
      with reduced risk of breast cancer-specific death, irrespective of pre-treatment 
      lobule involution.

TI  - Gut microbiome composition in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of
      Latinos is shaped by geographic relocation, environmental factors, and obesity.
LID - 219
AB  - Background: Hispanics living in the USA may have unrecognized potential
      birthplace and lifestyle influences on the gut microbiome. We report a
      cross-sectional analysis of 1674 participants from four centers of the Hispanic
      Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), aged 18 to 74 years old at
      recruitment. Results: Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene V4 and fungal ITS1
      fragments from self-collected stool samples indicate that the host microbiome is 
      determined by sociodemographic and migration-related variables. Those who
      relocate from Latin America to the USA at an early age have reductions in
      Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios that persist across the life course. Shannon
      index of alpha diversity in fungi and bacteria is low in those who relocate to
      the USA in early life. In contrast, those who relocate to the USA during
      adulthood, over 45 years old, have high bacterial and fungal diversity and high
      Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios, compared to USA-born and childhood arrivals.
      Low bacterial diversity is associated in turn with obesity. Contrasting with
      prior studies, our study of the Latino population shows increasing Prevotella to 
      Bacteroides ratio with greater obesity. Taxa within Acidaminococcus, Megasphaera,
      Ruminococcaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Christensenellaceae, YS2
      (Cyanobacteria), and Victivallaceae are significantly associated with both
      obesity and earlier exposure to the USA, while Oscillospira and Anaerotruncus
      show paradoxical associations with both obesity and late-life introduction to the
      USA. Conclusions: Our analysis of the gut microbiome of Latinos demonstrates
      unique features that might be responsible for health disparities affecting
      Hispanics living in the USA.

TI  - The characteristics of cognitive neuroscience tests in a schizophrenia cognition 
      clinical trial: Psychometric properties and correlations with standard measures.
LID - 100161
AB  - In comparison to batteries of standard neuropsychological tests, cognitive
      neuroscience tests may offer a more specific assessment of discrete
      neurobiological processes that may be aberrant in schizophrenia. However, more
      information regarding psychometric properties and correlations with standard
      neuropsychological tests and functional measures is warranted to establish their 
      validity as treatment outcome measures. The N-back and AX-Continuous Performance 
      Task (AX-CPT) are two promising cognitive neuroscience tests designed to measure 
      specific components of working memory and contextual processing respectively. In 
      the current study, we report the psychometric properties of multiple outcome
      measures from these two tests as well as their correlations with standard
      neuropsychological measures and functional capacity measures. The results suggest
      that while the AX-CPT and N-back display favorable psychometric properties, they 
      do not exhibit greater sensitivity or specificity with functional measures than
      standard neurocognitive tests.

TI  - A review of the use of time‐varying covariates in the Fine‐Gray subdistribution
      hazard competing risk regression model.
PG  - 103-13
AB  - In survival analysis, time‐varying covariates are covariates whose value can
      change during follow‐up. Outcomes in medical research are frequently subject to
      competing risks (events precluding the occurrence of the primary outcome). We
      review the types of time‐varying covariates and highlight the effect of their
      inclusion in the subdistribution hazard model. External time‐dependent covariates
      are external to the subject, can effect the failure process, but are not
      otherwise involved in the failure mechanism. Internal time‐varying covariates are
      measured on the subject, can effect the failure process directly, and may also be
      impacted by the failure mechanism. In the absence of competing risks, a
      consequence of including internal time‐dependent covariates in the Cox model is
      that one cannot estimate the survival function or the effect of covariates on the
      survival function. In the presence of competing risks, the inclusion of internal 
      time‐varying covariates in a subdistribution hazard model results in the loss of 
      the ability to estimate the cumulative incidence function (CIF) or the effect of 
      covariates on the CIF. Furthermore, the definition of the risk set for the
      subdistribution hazard function can make defining internal time‐varying
      covariates difficult or impossible. We conducted a review of the use of
      time‐varying covariates in subdistribution hazard models in articles published in
      the medical literature in 2015 and in the first 5 months of 2019. Seven percent
      of articles published included a time‐varying covariate. Several inappropriately 
      described a time‐varying covariate as having an association with the risk of the 
      outcome.

TI  - Youth source of acquisition for E-Cigarettes.
LID - 101011
AB  - As rates of traditional cigarette smoking have decreased among youth over the
      past several years, rates of e-cigarette use have increased. Little evidence
      exists on how youth obtain e-cigarettes. We used data from middle and high school
      students under the age of 18 who reported using an e-cigarette in the past
      30 days from the 2017 North Carolina Youth Tobacco Survey (n = 640). We used
      chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regressions to examine correlates of 
      access and place of acquisition. Over half (51.5%) of youth report acquiring
      e-cigarettes from a friend. Youth in 12th grade had higher odds of acquiring
      e-cigarettes from a vape shop (aOR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.25, 5.15) or retail outlet
      (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.18, 4.90) than youth in middle school. Compared to
      non-Hispanic white youth, Hispanic youth had lower odds of acquiring e-cigarettes
      from a vape shop (aOR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.87). Youth living with someone who
      uses e-cigarettes, compared to those who did not, had higher odds of acquiring
      e-cigarettes from a family member (aOR: 3.95, 95% CI: 1.94, 8.05). Finally,
      current smokers had higher odds of acquiring e-cigarettes from a retail outlet
      (aOR: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.88, 5.70) and lower odds of acquiring e-cigarettes from a
      friend (aOR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.77). Youth primarily reported obtaining
      e-cigarettes from a friend. Living with someone who uses e-cigarettes may be a
      risk factor for acquiring e-cigarettes from family members. Identifying sources
      of e-cigarette acquisition will help inform interventions preventing youth
      e-cigarette access.

      and Preliminary Results.
LID - 1137
AB  - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, space-flight associated neuro-ocular
      syndrome (SANS), and glaucoma are conditions that are among a spectrum of
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-related ophthalmologic disease. This implies that local
      CSF pressures at the level of the optic nerve are involved to variable extent in 
      these disease processes. However, CSF pressure measurements are problematic due
      to invasiveness and interpretation. The pressure measured by a lumbar puncture is
      likely not the same as the orbital CSF pressure. It is believed this is at least 
      in part due to the flow restrictive properties of the optic canal. To investigate
      CSF flow within the orbit, a model for CSF dynamics was created using three
      medium-sized pigs. Contrast was administered through a lumbar subarachnoid space 
      access. The contrast front was imaged with repeated computed tomographic (CT)
      imaging. Once contrast entered the orbit, rapid, sequential CT imaging was
      performed until the contrast reached the posterior globe. Head tilting was
      performed to highlight the role of gravitational dependence within the
      subarachnoid space.

LID - e0219637
AB  - Prior studies have analyzed growth of musculoskeletal tissues between species or 
      across body segments; however, little research has assessed the differences in
      similar tissues within a single joint. Here we studied changes in the length and 
      cross-sectional area of four ligaments and tendons, (anterior cruciate ligament, 
      patellar tendon, medial collateral ligament, lateral collateral ligament) in the 
      tibiofemoral joint of female Yorkshire pigs through high-field magnetic resonance
      imaging throughout growth. Tissue lengths increased by 4- to 5-fold from birth to
      late adolescence across the tissues while tissue cross-sectional area increased
      by 10–20-fold. The anterior cruciate ligament and lateral collateral ligament
      showed allometric growth favoring change in length over change in cross-sectional
      area while the patellar tendon and medial collateral ligament grow in an
      isometric manner. Additionally, changes in the length and cross-sectional area of
      the anterior cruciate ligament did not increase as much as in the other ligaments
      and tendon of interest. Overall, these findings suggest that musculoskeletal soft
      tissue morphometry can vary within tissues of similar structure and within a
      single joint during post-natal growth.

PG  - 2425-32
AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), caused by deficiency of α‐L‐iduronidase
      results in progressive, multisystemic disease with a broad phenotypic spectrum
      including patients with severe (Hurler syndrome) to attenuated (Hurler–Scheie and
      Scheie syndromes) disease. Disordered growth is common with either phenotype. The
      study objectives were to construct sex‐ and age‐specific estimated length/height 
      and head circumference growth curves for untreated individuals with severe and
      attenuated disease and compare them with clinical reference standards. Untreated 
      individuals in the MPS I Registry with at least one observation for length/height
      and/or head circumference and assigned phenotype as of May 2017 were included.
      Median growth for 463 untreated individuals with severe disease deviated from
      reference growth curves by ~6 months of age and fell below the third percentile
      by 4 years of age. Median head circumference was above reference curves from 3 to
      4 months through 3 years of age. Among 207 individuals with untreated attenuated 
      disease, median height fell below the third percentile by 9 years of age with
      divergence from reference curves by 2 years of age. MPS I‐specific growth curves 
      will be useful in evaluation of long‐term outcomes of therapeutics interventions 
      and will provide a foundation for understanding the pathogenesis of skeletal
      disease in MPS I.

TI  - Effects of exenatide and open-label SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, given in parallel 
      or sequentially, on mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2
      diabetes: insights from the EXSCEL trial.
LID - 138
AB  - Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes through distinct mechanisms. However, evidence
      on clinical outcomes in patients treated with both GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i is
      lacking. We aim to provide insight into the effects of open-label SGLT2i use in
      parallel with or shortly after once-weekly GLP-1 RA exenatide (EQW) on
      cardiorenal outcomes. Methods: In the EXSCEL cardiovascular outcomes trial EQW
      arm, SGLT2i drop-in occurred in 8.7% of participants. These EQW+SGLT2i users were
      propensity-matched to: (1) placebo-arm participants not taking SGLT2i (n = 572
      per group); and to (2) EQW-arm participants not taking SGLT2i (n = 575), based on
      their last measured characteristics before SGLT2i initiation, and equivalent
      study visit in comparator groups. Time-to-first major adverse cardiovascular
      event (MACE) and all-cause mortality (ACM) were compared using Cox regression
      analyses. eGFR slopes were quantified using mixed model repeated measurement
      analyses. Results: In adjusted analyses, the risk for MACE with combination
      EQW+SGLT2i use was numerically lower compared with both placebo (adjusted hazard 
      ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.39–1.17) and EQW alone (0.85, 0.48–1.49). Risk of ACM was
      nominally significantly reduced compared with placebo (0.38, 0.16–0.90) and
      compared with EQW (0.41, 0.17–0.95). Combination EQW+SGLT2i use also nominally
      significantly improved estimated eGFR slope compared with placebo (+ 1.94, 95% CI
      0.94–2.94 mL/min/1.73 m2/year) and EQW alone (+ 2.38,
      1.40–3.35 mL/min/1.73 m2/year). Conclusions: This post hoc analysis supports the 
      hypothesis that combinatorial EQW and SGLT2i therapy may provide benefit on
      cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov,

TI  - The effectiveness of marine based fatty acid compound (PCSO-524) and firocoxib in
      the treatment of canine osteoarthritis.
LID - 349
AB  - Background: NSAIDs are accepted as the most predictably efficacious medical
      treatment of the clinical signs of osteoarthritis (OA). The marine-based
      fatty-acid compound PCSO-524 has been proposed as an adjunctive treatment for
      canine OA, however benefits of this agent is still controversial. The purpose of 
      this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of PCSO-524 combined
      with the NSAID firocoxib using force plate gait analysis, orthopedic assessment
      score (OAS) and canine brief pain inventory score (CBPI) in dogs with OA.A
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted. Seventy-nine dogs
      that had hip and/or stifle OA were assigned randomly into three treatment groups:
      firocoxib, PCSO-524 and combination of firocoxib and PCSO-524, orally for
      4 weeks. Peak vertical force (PVF, expressed as a percentage of bodyweight), OAS,
      CBPI, serum prostaglandin E2 concentration, hematology and blood chemistry values
      were evaluated before treatment (Day0), as well as at the second (Day14) and
      fourth week (Day28) during treatment. Results: Within group analysis revealed
      significant increases in PVF over the 4-week treatment period for firocoxib,
      PCSO-524 and the combination (p < 0.05). Mean increases in PVF were 3.25 ± 4.13, 
      2.01 ± 3.86, 4.11 ± 4.69%BW (mean ± SD) respectively. The OAS showed
      non-significant change in all treatment groups. There were significant decreases 
      in CBPI pain severity score (PSS) and CBPI pain interference scores (PIS) within 
      some groups over time, however no significant differences were found between the 
      groups. Significantly decreased serum PGE2 concentration (p < 0.05) was found in 
      the combination group. Significant increases in BUN and creatinine (p < 0.05)
      compared to pre-treatment values were found in the firocoxib and combination
      groups but not in the PCSO-524 group at day28, but all values in all dogs
      remained within the normal ranges. Conclusions: The results of this study
      suggested combination of both PCSO-524 and firocoxib is more effective in
      alleviation of inflammation and improvement of weight bearing ability when
      compared to the uses of either PCSO-524 or firocoxib alone. Further clinical
      studies are needed to confirm this, and to determine if there is any benefit of
      PCSO-524 over placebo.

TI  - Genetic analysis of hsCRP in American Indians: The Strong Heart Family Study.
LID - e0223574
AB  - Background: Increased serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an important
      component of the innate immune response, are associated with increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have
      been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian randomization
      studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing CRP expression 
      and risk of colon cancer (but thus far not CVD). The effects of individual
      genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a population and
      hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP in a number of
      American Indian populations. Methods: The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has
      serum CRP measurements from 2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from
      three regions of the United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined
      SNP genotypes were incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based
      linkage and association analyses. Results: CRP levels exhibited significant
      heritability (h2 = 0.33 ± 0.05, p<1.3 X 10−20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6,
      near marker D6S281 (approximately at 169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive
      linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No individual SNPs were found associated with 
      CRP levels after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (threshold <7.77 x
      10−7), however, we found nominal associations, many of which replicate previous
      findings at the CRP, HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association
      of 46 SNPs located at 7 novel loci on chromosomes 2, 5, 6(2 loci), 9, 10 and 17, 
      with an average of 15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7.2 X
      10−4. Conclusion: In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data
      show CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci,
      such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic
      groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other
      chromosomes that warrant further investigation.

      spectrum of disease, complicating treatment options. Spinocerebellar ataxia
      autosomal recessive 16 (SCAR16) is caused by coding mutations in STUB1, a gene
      that encodes the multifunctional enzyme CHIP (C terminus of HSC70-interacting
      protein). The disease spectrum of SCAR16 includes a varying age of disease onset,
      cognitive dysfunction, increased tendon reflex, and hypogonadism. Although SCAR16
      mutations span the multiple functional domains of CHIP, it is unclear whether the
      location of the mutation and the change in the biochemical properties of CHIP
      contributes to the clinical spectrum of SCAR16. In this study, we examined
      relationships between the clinical phenotypes of SCAR16 patients and the changes 
      in biophysical, biochemical, and functional properties of the corresponding
      mutated protein. We found that the severity of ataxia did not correlate with age 
      of onset; however, cognitive dysfunction, increased tendon reflex, and ancestry
      were able to predict 54% of the variation in ataxia severity. We further
      identified domain-specific relationships between biochemical changes in CHIP and 
      clinical phenotypes and specific biochemical activities that associate
      selectively with either increased tendon reflex or cognitive dysfunction,
      suggesting that specific changes to CHIP–HSC70 dynamics contribute to the
      clinical spectrum of SCAR16. Finally, linear models of SCAR16 as a function of
      the biochemical properties of CHIP support the concept that further inhibiting
      mutant CHIP activity lessens disease severity and may be useful in the design of 
      patient-specific targeted approaches to treat SCAR16.

TI  - The trial to reduce antimicrobial use in nursing home residents with Alzheimer’s 
      disease and other dementias: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled
      trial.
LID - 594
AB  - Background: Infections are common in nursing home (NH) residents with advanced
      dementia but are often managed inappropriately. Antimicrobials are extensively
      prescribed, but frequently with insufficient evidence to support a bacterial
      infection, promoting the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms. Moreover,
      the benefits of antimicrobials remain unclear in these seriously ill residents
      for whom comfort is often the goal of care. Prior NH infection management
      interventions evaluated in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) did not consider
      patient preferences and lack evidence to support their effectiveness in
      ‘real-world’ practice. Methods: This report presents the rationale and
      methodology of TRAIN-AD (Trial to reduce antimicrobial use in nursing home
      residents with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias), a parallel group,
      cluster RCT evaluating a multicomponent intervention to improve infection
      management for suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) and lower respiratory
      tract infections (LRIs) among NH residents with advanced dementia. TRAIN-AD is
      being conducted in 28 facilities in the Boston, USA, area randomized in waves
      using minimization to achieve a balance on key characteristics (N = 14
      facilities/arm). The involvement of the facilities includes a 3-month start-up
      period and a 24-month implementation/data collection phase. Residents are
      enrolled during the first 12 months of the 24-month implementation period and
      followed for up to 12 months. Individual consent is waived, thus almost all
      eligible residents are enrolled (target sample size, N = 410). The intervention
      integrates infectious disease and palliative care principles and includes
      provider training delivered through multiple modalities (in-person seminar,
      online course, management algorithms, and prescribing feedback) and an
      information booklet for families. Control facilities employ usual care. The
      primary outcome, abstracted from the residents’ charts, is the number of
      antimicrobial courses prescribed for UTIs and LRIs per person-year alive.
      Discussion: TRAIN-AD is the first cluster RCT testing a multicomponent
      intervention to improve infection management in NH residents with advanced
      dementia. Its findings will provide an evidence base to support the benefit of a 
      program addressing the critical clinical and public health problem of
      antimicrobial misuse in these seriously ill residents. Moreover, its hybrid
      efficacy-effectiveness design will inform the future conduct of cluster RCTs
      evaluating nonpharmacological interventions in the complex NH setting in a way
      that is both internally valid and adaptable to the ‘real-world’. Trial

TI  - Recruitment and retention of families interested in a parent-based pediatric
      obesity intervention.
LID - 100467
AB  - Recruitment and retention in pediatric obesity treatment remains challenging,
      especially for groups at highest risk of this condition, including African
      Americans. However, most investigations examine attrition during intervention or 
      follow-up. Little is known about those who refuse enrollment, or drop out at
      baseline. Thus, the trajectory of recruitment, enrollment, and retention,
      especially at these early stages, is not well understood, limiting knowledge of
      treatment access. This study examined enrollment in a pediatric weight management
      intervention. We provide demographic information on nested consort flow groups.
      We compared non-overlapping interest/enrollment groups to examine differences
      between those who progressed to the next consort flow group and those who did
      not; specifically the four groups examined were: (1) eligible at screening, did
      not attend baseline (nchildren = 261), (2) attended baseline, did not enroll
      (nchildren = 46), (3) enrolled, did not complete posttesting (nchildren = 81),
      and (4) completed posttesting (nchildren = 284). Of enrolled families, >70% were 
      African American; >78% completed posttesting. No differences emerged across
      groups on sex, ethnicity, or race (ps > .05). Attrition was unrelated to initial 
      child BMI. In this trial, the goal of enrolling diverse parents of children with 
      obesity was achieved, and most enrollees completed treatment.

LID - e1913123
AB  - Question: Is gait speed measured at age 45 years associated with accelerated
      biological aging, neurocognitive function, and cognitive decline? Findings: In
      this 5-decade cohort study of 904 participants in New Zealand, physical and
      biological indicators of accelerated aging, including compromised brain integrity
      (eg, reduced brain volume and cortical thickness), were associated with slow gait
      measured at age 45 years. Lifelong compromised brain health—including poor
      neurocognitive functioning as early as age 3 years and childhood-to-adulthood
      decline in cognitive functioning—was associated with slower gait at midlife.
      Meaning: Gait speed at midlife may be a summary index of lifelong aging with
      possible origins in childhood central nervous system deficits.

      trial in Indonesia, Ukraine, and Vietnam: HPTN 074.
LID - e0223829
AB  - Background: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) have high HIV incidence and
      prevalence, and may have limited access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in some
      settings. We evaluated HIV drug resistance in PWID in a randomized clinical trial
      (HPTN 074). The study intervention included ART at any CD4 cell count with
      enhanced support for ART and substance use treatment. Methods: HPTN 074 enrolled 
      HIV-infected PWID (index participants) with viral loads ≥1,000 copies/mL and
      their HIV-uninfected injection-network partners in Indonesia, Ukraine, and
      Vietnam; the study limited enrollment of people who reported being on ART. HIV
      drug resistance testing and antiretroviral (ARV) drug testing were performed
      using samples collected from index participants at study enrollment. Results:
      Fifty-four (12.0%) of 449 participants had HIV drug resistance; 29 (53.7%) of the
      54 participants had multi-class resistance. Prevalence of resistance varied by
      study site and was associated with self-report of prior or current ART, detection
      of ARV drugs, and a history of incarceration. Resistance was detected in 10
      (5.6%) of 177 newly diagnosed participants. Participants with resistance at
      enrollment were less likely to be virally suppressed after 52 weeks of follow-up,
      independent of study arm. Conclusions: In HPTN 074, many of the enrolled index
      participants had HIV drug resistance and more than half of those had multi-class 
      resistance. Some newly-diagnosed participants had resistance, suggesting that
      they may have been infected with drug-resistant HIV strains. Behavioral and
      geographic factors were associated with baseline resistance. Baseline resistance 
      was associated with reduced viral suppression during study follow-up. These
      findings indicate the need for enhanced HIV care in this high-risk population to 
      achieve sustained viral suppression on ART.

TI  - States with higher minimum wages have lower STI rates among women: Results of an 
      ecological study of 66 US metropolitan areas, 2003-2015.
LID - e0223579
AB  - Prior research has found that places and people that are more economically
      disadvantaged have higher rates and risks, respectively, of sexually transmitted 
      infections (STIs). Economic disadvantages at the level of places and people,
      however, are themselves influenced by economic policies. To enhance the policy
      relevance of STI research, we explore, for the first time, the relationship
      between state-level minimum wage policies and STI rates among women in a cohort
      of 66 large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US spanning 2003–2015.
      Our annual state-level minimum wage measure was adjusted for inflation and cost
      of living. STI outcomes (rates of primary and secondary syphilis, gonorrhea and
      chlamydia per 100,000 women) were obtained from the CDC. We used multivariable
      hierarchical linear models to test the hypothesis that higher minimum wages would
      be associated with lower STI rates. We preliminarily explored possible
      socioeconomic mediators of the minimum wage/STI relationship (e.g., MSA-level
      rates of poverty, employment, and incarceration). We found that a $1 increase in 
      the price-adjusted minimum wage over time was associated with a 19.7% decrease in
      syphilis rates among women and with an 8.5% drop in gonorrhea rates among women. 
      The association between minimum wage and chlamydia rates did not meet our
      cutpoint for substantive significance. Preliminary mediation analyses suggest
      that MSA-level employment among women may mediate the relationship between
      minimum wage and gonorrhea. Consistent with an emerging body of research on
      minimum wage and health, our findings suggest that increasing the minimum wage
      may have a protective effect on STI rates among women. If other studies support
      this finding, public health strategies to reduce STIs among women should include 
      advocating for a higher minimum wage.

TI  - Design and rationale of the North Indian ST‐Segment Elevation Myocardial
      Infarction Registry: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1140-6
AB  - ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with increased
      mortality and morbidity. Although remarkable progress has been made in the
      management of STEMI in high‐income countries, contemporary data to evaluate
      processes and outcomes of STEMI care in India is limited. The North Indian
      ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NORIN STEMI) registry is a
      prospective cohort study based at government funded and largely free of cost
      tertiary medical centers in New Delhi, India. These hospitals serve a large
      proportion of the patients with lower socioeconomic status presenting from
      multiple states in India, as many centers in these states lack adequate
      specialized cardiovascular care. The study has been approved by the Institutional
      Review Boards of each institution and informed consent has been obtained from
      study participants. The NORIN STEMI registry aims to provide important insights
      regarding contemporary risk factors profiles, practice patterns, and prognosis in
      patients with STEMI in an underserved population in North India. These findings
      may identify opportunities to improve the outcomes of patients with STEMI in
      India.

TI  - Association of Restrictive Housing During Incarceration With Mortality After
      Release.
LID - e1912516
AB  - Question: Is restrictive housing, otherwise known as solitary confinement, during
      incarceration associated with an increased risk of mortality after release into
      the community? Findings: This cohort study included 229 274 people who were
      released from incarceration in North Carolina from 2000 to 2015. Compared with
      individuals who were incarcerated and not placed in restrictive housing,
      individuals who spent any time in restrictive housing were 24% more likely to die
      in the first year after release, especially from suicide (78% more likely) and
      homicide (54% more likely); they were also 127% more likely to die of an opioid
      overdose in the first 2 weeks after release. Meaning: The results of this study
      suggest that exposure to restrictive housing as a condition of confinement is
      associated with an increased risk of death during community reentry.

TI  - Longitudinal Associations between Monetary Value of the Diet, DASH Diet Score and
      the Allostatic Load among Middle-Aged Urban Adults.
LID - 2360
AB  - Lower cost can lead to poorer-quality diets, potentially worsening metabolic
      profiles. We explored these pathways among urban adults. Longitudinal data were
      extracted from 1224–1479 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of
      Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. DASH(mean) (Dietary Approaches to 
      Stop Hypertension) score was computed using four 24 h recalls (v1/v2: 2004–2013) 
      linked with a national food price database to estimate monetary value of the diet
      [MVD(mean)]. Allostatic load (AL) was measured at visits 2 (v2) and 3 (v3) in
      2009–2018. Mixed-effects regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) were
      conducted, linking MVD(mean)/DASH(mean) to AL [v2 and annual change(v3–v2)] and
      exploring mediating pathways between MVD(mean) and AL(v3) through DASH(mean),
      stratifying by sex, race and poverty status. MVD(mean) tertiles were linearly
      associated with contemporaneous DASH(mean), after energy adjustment. In
      mixed-effects regression models, DASH(mean) was consistently linked to lower
      AL(v2). DASH(mean) and MVD(mean) were positively associated with higher serum
      albumin(v2). In SEM, MVD(mean) was linked to AL(v3) through DASH(mean), mainly
      among Whites and specifically for the cholesterol and Waist-Hip-Ratio AL
      components. In summary, energy and other covariate-adjusted increase in MVD may
      have a sizeable impact on DASH which can reduce follow-up AL among urban White
      middle-aged adults. More studies are needed to replicate findings in comparable
      samples of urban adults.

TI  - American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High-Risk
      Areas (The LITE Study): Protocol for a Multisite Prospective Cohort Study in the 
      Eastern and Southern United States.
LID - e14704
AB  - Background: In the United States, transgender women (TW) are disproportionately
      burdened by HIV infection. Cohort studies are needed to evaluate factors driving 
      HIV acquisition among TW over time. These will require implementation strategies 
      that are acceptable to the TW community and feasible to implement. Objective:
      This study aims to investigate the rate and correlates of HIV acquisition and
      other health outcomes among TW in eastern and southern United States. Methods:
      LITE is a multisite prospective cohort in 6 eastern and southern US cities, which
      will be followed across 24 months of technology-enhanced biobehavioral follow-up.
      Adult TW, regardless of HIV status, are recruited via convenience sampling (eg,
      peer referrals, social media, and dating apps). Participants are enrolled in a
      baseline study visit, complete a sociobehavioral survey, and test for HIV and
      sexually transmitted infections. Participants who are not living with HIV at
      baseline are offered enrollment into the cohort (N=1100); follow-up assessments
      occur quarterly. Results: Cohort assembly was informed by synchronous Web-based
      focus group discussions with TW (n=41) and by continuing engagement with
      community advisory board members from each site. Enrollment launched in March
      2018. The study is underway in the Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Miami; New York
      City; and Washington, DC, metro areas. As of March 2019, 795 TW completed a
      baseline visit (mean age 35 years). The majority of the participants are
      racial/ethnic minorities, with 45% of the TW identifying as black and 28% of the 
      TW identifying as Hispanic/Latinx. More than one-quarter (28%) of the TW are
      living with HIV infection (laboratory-confirmed). Online recruitment methods
      support engagement with TW, although peer referral and referral through trusted
      health facilities and organizations remain most effective. Conclusions: This
      study is responsive to increasing research interest in technology-enhanced
      methods for cohort research, particularly for hard-to-reach populations.
      Importantly, the diversity of literacy, technology use, and overall socioeconomic
      situations in this sample of TW highlights the need to leverage technology to
      permit a flexible, adaptive methodology that enhances engagement of potential
      participants living in marginalized contexts while still ensuring rigorous and
      sound study design. International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID):

TI  - Silica Exposure Differentially Modulates Autoimmunity in Lupus Strains and
      Autoantibody Transgenic Mice.
LID - 2336
AB  - Inhalational exposure to crystalline silica is linked to several debilitating
      systemic autoimmune diseases characterized by a prominent humoral immune
      component, but the mechanisms by which silica induces autoantibodies is poorly
      understood. To better understand how silica lung exposure breaks B cell tolerance
      and unleashes autoreactive B cells, we exposed both wildtype mice of healthy
      C57BL/6 and lupus-prone BXSB, MRL, and NZB strains and mice carrying an
      autoantibody transgene on each of these backgrounds to instilled silica or
      vehicle and monitored lung injury, autoimmunity, and B cell fate. Silica exposure
      induced lung damage and pulmonary lymphoid aggregates in all strains, including
      in genetically diverse backgrounds and in autoantibody transgenic models. In
      wildtype mice strain differences were observed in specificity of autoantibodies
      and site of enhanced autoantibody production, consistent with genetic modulation 
      of the autoimmune response to silica. The unique autoantibody transgene reporter 
      system permitted the in vivo fate of autoreactive B cells and tolerance
      mechanisms to be tracked directly, and demonstrated the presence of transgenic B 
      cells and antibody in pulmonary lymphoid aggregates and bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid, respectively, as well as in spleen and serum. Nonetheless, B cell
      enumeration and transgenic antibody quantitation indicated that B cell deletion
      and anergy were intact in the different genetic backgrounds. Thus, silica
      exposure sufficient to induce substantial lung immunopathology did not overtly
      disrupt central B cell tolerance, even when superimposed on autoimmune genetic
      susceptibility. This suggests that silica exposure subverts tolerance at
      alternative checkpoints, such as regulatory cells or follicle entry, or requires 
      additional interactions or co-exposures to induce loss of tolerance. This
      possibility is supported by results of differentiation assays that demonstrated
      transgenic autoantibodies in supernatants of Toll-like receptor
      (TLR)7/TLR9-stimulated splenocytes harvested from silica-exposed, but not
      vehicle-exposed, C57BL/6 mice. This suggests that lung injury induced by silica
      exposure has systemic effects that subtly alter autoreactive B cell regulation,
      possibly modulating B cell anergy, and that can be unmasked by superimposed
      exposure to TLR ligands or other immunostimulants.

TI  - Association of metformin and statin medications with surrogate measures of
      cardiovascular disease in youth with type 1 diabetes: the SEARCH for diabetes in 
      youth study.
PG  - 187-94
AB  - Purpose: Youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are at risk of cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). We evaluated if metformin or statin use was associated with
      surrogate measures of improved CVD. Methods: We included participants from the
      SEARCH observational study. Participants treated with insulin plus metformin
      (n=42) or insulin plus statin (n=39) were matched with 84 and 78 participants,
      respectively, treated with insulin alone. Measures of arterial stiffness obtained
      were pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI75), and heart rate
      variability as standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN) and
      root mean square differences of successive NN intervals (RMSSD). Results: CVD
      measures were not significantly different among participants on insulin plus
      metformin versus those on insulin alone: PWV (5.9±1.0 m/sec vs. 5.8±1.5 m/sec,
      P=0.730), AI75 (1.8 [-6.0 to 8.0] vs. -2.4 [-10.7 to 3.8], P=0.157), SDNN (52.4
      [36.8–71.1] m/sec vs. 51.8 [40.1–74.9] m/sec, P=0.592), and RMSSD (43.2
      [29.4–67.6] vs. 47.4 [28.0–76.3], P=0.952). CVD measures were not different for
      statin users versus nonusers: PWV (5.7±0.8 m/sec vs. 5.9 ±1.1 m/sec, P=0.184),
      AI75 ( -4.0 [-9.5 to 1.7] vs. -6.7 [-11.3 to 5.7], P=0.998), SDNN (54.6
      [43.5–77.2] m/sec vs. 63.1 [44.2–86.6] m/sec, P=0.369), and RMSSD (49.5
      [31.2–74.8] vs. 59.2 [38.3–86.3], P=0.430). Conclusions: We found no associations
      of statin or metformin use with surrogate measures of CVD. Future prospective
      pediatric clinical trials could address this issue.

TI  - Didgeridoo Sound Meditation for Stress Reduction and Mood Enhancement in
      Undergraduates: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 2164956119879367
AB  - Background: College students report feeling frequently stressed, which adversely 
      impacts health. Meditation is one effective method for reducing stress, but
      program length and required effort are potential obstacles. Research on sound
      meditation, involving focused listening to sounds, is nascent but may appeal to
      undergraduates. The effects of listening to didgeridoo, an Australian wind
      instrument producing a low, resonant, droning sound, have not been studied.
      Objective: This study compared the effect of a 30-minute didgeridoo sound
      meditation versus silent meditation with focus on one’s breath on acute
      self-perceived stress and mood in undergraduates without prior meditation
      experience. Methods: Seventy-four undergraduates were randomized to 2
      interventions: (1) didgeridoo meditation (n = 40) performed live by a musician or
      (2) silent meditation (n = 34) taught by a meditation instructor. Immediate
      pre–post effects of the session were examined using the 4-Dimension Mood Scale
      and an item assessing acute self-perceived stress. Intervention acceptability was
      assessed postintervention. Results: Two-way mixed analyses of variance were
      performed. Both groups reported significantly increased relaxation after
      meditation (Group D, P = .0001 and Group S, P = .0005). Both groups reported
      decreased negative arousal (Group D, P = .02 and Group S, P = .02), energy (Group
      D, P = .0001 and Group S, P = .003), tiredness (Group D, P = .0001 and Group S,
      P = .005), and acute stress (Group D, P = .0001 and Group S, P = .0007). Group
      Didgeridoo experienced significantly more relaxation (P = .01) and less acute
      stress (P = .03) than Group Silent. Fifty-three percent of silent participants
      and 80% of didgeridoo participants agreed that they would attend that type of
      meditation again. Forty-seven percent of silent participants and 80% of
      didgeridoo participants enjoyed the meditation. Conclusion: Didgeridoo sound
      meditation is as effective as silent meditation for decreasing self-perceived
      negative arousal, tiredness, and energy and more effective than silent meditation
      for relaxation and acute stress in undergraduates. Didgeridoo meditation
      participants reported higher levels of enjoyment and higher likelihood of
      attending another session. Further investigation into didgeridoo and sound
      meditation is warranted.

TI  - Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Risk for Early Incident Atrial Fibrillation: A 
      Prospective Cohort Study of 1.1 Million Young Adults.
LID - e013741
AB  - Background: Acute psychological stress and negative emotions are known risk
      factors for atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether exposure to chronic stress
      syndromes, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), also increases
      susceptibility to AF is unknown. Methods and Results: We prospectively assessed
      the incidence of AF over a 13‐year period among 988 090 young and middle‐aged
      veterans (mean age, 30.29±9.19 years; 87.8% men, 64.5% white) who first accessed 
      care through the Veterans Health Administration from October 2001 to November
      2014 and were free of AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia at baseline.
      Time‐varying, multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine
      the independent contribution of PTSD to new AF. We also tested for effect
      modification by sex and controlled for healthcare use. During a mean follow‐up of
      4.8 years, 2491 patients were diagnosed with AF. Patients with PTSD had a higher 
      overall incidence of AF (P<0.0001) and were more likely to develop AF at a
      younger age than those without PTSD (P=0.004). PTSD was significantly associated 
      with incident AF in unadjusted models (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.19–1.43) and
      models that adjusted for demographics, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular risk
      factors, and depression (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02–1.24). The interaction 
      with sex was nonsignificant (P=0.93). Conclusions: PTSD was associated increased 
      risk for early incident AF after adjustment for established AF risk factors and
      depression in this cohort of young and middle‐aged veterans. Findings from this
      study require validation in more diverse populations to determine their
      generalizability.

TI  - Impact of a Quality Improvement Initiative to Optimize the Discharge Process of
      Pediatric Gastroenterology Patients at an Academic Children’s Hospital.
LID - e213
AB  - Discharge is an important and complex process that can be optimized to reduce
      inpatient healthcare inefficiency and waste. This study aimed to increase the
      percentage of patients discharged before 1 pm by 20% from an academic inpatient
      pediatric gastroenterology service (IPGS), over 6 months.Methods:: We conducted a
      preintervention and postintervention study of patients discharged from IPGS.
      Patients discharged from January to June 2016, and those following our
      intervention from June to December 2016, were studied. Interventions included (1)
      implementation of the electronic medical record medical and logistical discharge 
      criteria checklists for the 4 most common IPGS discharge diagnoses, (2)
      standardization of the rounds process to prioritize discharge, (3) education of
      nursing staff and families about the role they played in discharge. Process,
      outcome, and balancing measures were analyzed. Results:: Three hundred fifty-five
      total discharges were studied. Between the preintervention and postintervention
      groups, there were no significant improvements in discharge order time, physical 
      discharge time, discharge response time, or discharges before 1 pm. The balancing
      measure of 30-day readmission was unaffected. However, length of stay (LOS)
      index, calculated as the ratio of actual to expected LOS, improved; when
      translated into days, LOS declined by 1 day, with potential associated savings of
      $373,000. Conclusions:: Interventions to improve discharge timeliness on IPGS
      service demonstrated mixed effectiveness. Only LOS index improved. Further
      iterative quality improvement interventions are needed to continue optimizing
      discharge timeliness and change the culture of pediatric discharge on inpatient
      subspecialty services in academic children’s hospitals.

PG  - 2114-9
AB  - Our objective is to report longitudinal results of the MG‐ADL, MG‐Composite,
      MG‐MMT, and MG‐QoL15 in an open‐label trial of therapeutic plasma exchange in
      myasthenia gravis. Ten MG patients experiencing exacerbation had assessments
      prior to, immediately following, and at selected time points post‐TPE. Changes
      from baseline to 2 weeks post‐TPE were: MG‐ADL median −5.0, P < 0.0033, MG‐QoL15 
      median −13.0, P < 0.001, MG‐MMT median −10.0, P < 0.0001, and MG‐Composite median
      −10.0, P < 0.005. TPE produced a rapid, clinically significant change in all
      instruments, indicating these outcome measures are robust endpoints for clinical 
      trials of rapidly efficacious MG therapies.

TI  - Chronic Antibiotic Dependent Pouchitis Is Associated With Older Age at the Time
      of Ileal Pouch Anal Anastomosis (J-pouch) Surgery.
LID - otz029
AB  - Background: Risk factors for the development of chronic antibiotic dependent
      pouchitis (CADP) are not well understood. Methods: Using multivariable logistic
      regression, we compared clinical factors between 194 patients with acute
      antibiotic responsive pouchitis or CADP. Results: Individuals with CADP were
      significantly older (40.9 vs 30.8 years, P < 0.001) and demonstrated a longer
      disease duration before IPAA (10.3 vs 7.0 years, P = 0.004). Age ≥55 years at the
      time of IPAA was significantly associated with CADP (adjusted odds ratio = 4.35, 
      95% confidence interval = 1.01–18.7). Conclusions: Although older age should not 
      represent a barrier to IPAA, further studies evaluating etiologies of this
      association are warranted.

TI  - Rice bran supplementation modulates growth, microbiota and metabolome in weaning 
      infants: a clinical trial in Nicaragua and Mali.
LID - 13919
AB  - Rice bran supplementation provides nutrients, prebiotics and phytochemicals that 
      enhance gut immunity, reduce enteric pathogens and diarrhea, and warrants
      attention for improvement of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in children.
      EED is a subclinical condition associated with stunting due to impaired nutrient 
      absorption. This study investigated the effects of rice bran supplementation on
      weight for age and length for age z-scores (WAZ, LAZ), EED stool biomarkers, as
      well as microbiota and metabolome signatures in weaning infants from 6 to 12
      months old that reside in Nicaragua and Mali. Healthy infants were randomized to 
      a control (no intervention) or a rice bran group that received daily
      supplementation with increasing doses at each month (1–5 g/day). Stool microbiota
      were characterized using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Stool metabolomes were
      analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography tandem
      mass-spectrometry. Statistical comparisons were completed at 6, 8, and 12 months 
      of age. Daily consumption of rice bran was safe and feasible to support changes
      in LAZ from 6–8 and 8–12 months of age in Nicaragua and Mali infants when
      compared to control. WAZ was significantly improved only for Mali infants at 8
      and 12 months. Mali and Nicaraguan infants showed major differences in the
      overall gut microbiota and metabolome composition and structure at baseline, and 
      thus each country cohort demonstrated distinct microbial and metabolite profile
      responses to rice bran supplementation when compared to control. Rice bran is a
      practical dietary intervention strategy that merits development in rice-growing
      regions that have a high prevalence of growth stunting due to malnutrition and
      diarrheal diseases. Rice is grown as a staple food, and the bran is used as
      animal feed or wasted in many low- and middle-income countries where EED and
      stunting is prevalent.

TI  - Characterizing the Process Physics of Ultrasound-Assisted Bioprinting.
LID - 13889
AB  - 3D bioprinting has been evolving as an important strategy for the fabrication of 
      engineered tissues for clinical, diagnostic, and research applications. A major
      advantage of bioprinting is the ability to recapitulate the patient-specific
      tissue macro-architecture using cellular bioinks. The effectiveness of
      bioprinting can be significantly enhanced by incorporating the ability to
      preferentially organize cellular constituents within 3D constructs to mimic the
      intrinsic micro-architectural characteristics of native tissues. Accordingly,
      this work focuses on a new non-contact and label-free approach called
      ultrasound-assisted bioprinting (UAB) that utilizes acoustophoresis principle to 
      align cells within bioprinted constructs. We describe the underlying process
      physics and develop and validate computational models to determine the effects of
      ultrasound process parameters (excitation mode, excitation time, frequency,
      voltage amplitude) on the relevant temperature, pressure distribution, and
      alignment time characteristics. Using knowledge from the computational models, we
      experimentally investigate the effect of selected process parameters (frequency, 
      voltage amplitude) on the critical quality attributes (cellular strand width,
      inter-strand spacing, and viability) of MG63 cells in alginate as a model bioink 
      system. Finally, we demonstrate the UAB of bilayered constructs with parallel
      (0°–0°) and orthogonal (0°–90°) cellular alignment across layers. Results of this
      work highlight the key interplay between the UAB process design and
      characteristics of aligned cellular constructs, and represent an important next
      step in our ability to create biomimetic engineered tissues.

TI  - Ozone effects on blood biomarkers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress,
      endothelial function, and thrombosis: The Multicenter Ozone Study in oldEr
      Subjects (MOSES).
LID - e0222601
AB  - The evidence that exposure to ozone air pollution causes acute cardiovascular
      effects is mixed. We postulated that exposure to ambient levels of ozone would
      increase blood markers of systemic inflammation, prothrombotic state, oxidative
      stress, and vascular dysfunction in healthy older subjects, and that absence of
      the glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) gene would confer increased
      susceptibility. This double-blind, randomized, crossover study of 87 healthy
      volunteers 55–70 years of age was conducted at three sites using a common
      protocol. Subjects were exposed for 3 h in random order to 0 parts per billion
      (ppb) (filtered air), 70 ppb, and 120 ppb ozone, alternating 15 min of moderate
      exercise and rest. Blood was obtained the day before, approximately 4 h after,
      and approximately 22 h after each exposure. Linear mixed effect and logistic
      regression models evaluated the impact of exposure to ozone on pre-specified
      primary and secondary outcomes. The definition of statistical significance was
      p<0.01. There were no effects of ozone on the three primary markers of systemic
      inflammation and a prothrombotic state: C-reactive protein, monocyte-platelet
      conjugates, and microparticle-associated tissue factor activity. However, among
      the secondary endpoints, endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, increased from
      pre- to post-exposure with ozone concentration (120 vs 0 ppb: 0.07 pg/mL, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.01, 0.14; 70 vs 0 ppb: -0.03 pg/mL, CI -0.09, 0.04; p 
      = 0.008). Nitrotyrosine, a marker of oxidative and nitrosative stress, decreased 
      with increasing ozone concentrations, with marginal significance (120 vs 0 ppb:
      -41.5, CI -70.1, -12.8; 70 vs 0 ppb: -14.2, CI -42.7, 14.2; p = 0.017). GSTM1
      status did not modify the effect of ozone exposure on any of the outcomes. These 
      findings from healthy older adults fail to identify any mechanistic basis for the
      epidemiologically described cardiovascular effects of exposure to ozone. The
      findings, however, may not be applicable to adults with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Silymarin in non-cirrhotics with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial.
LID - e0221683
AB  - The botanical product silymarin, an extract of milk thistle, is commonly used by 
      patients to treat chronic liver disease and may be a treatment for NASH due to
      its antioxidant properties. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of higher 
      than customary doses of silymarin in non-cirrhotic patients with NASH. This
      exploratory randomized double-blind placebo controlled multicenter Phase II trial
      tested a proprietary standardized silymarin preparation (Legalon®,
      Rottapharm|Madaus, Mylan) and was conducted at 5 medical centers in the United
      States. Eligible adult patients had liver biopsy within 12 months showing NASH
      without cirrhosis with NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥4 per site pathologist’s
      assessment. Participants were randomized to Legalon® 420 mg, 700 mg, or placebo
      t.i.d. for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was histological improvement ≥2 points 
      in NAS. Of 116 patients screened, 78 were randomized. There were no significant
      differences in adverse events among the treatment groups. After 48–50 weeks, 4/27
      (15%) in the 700 mg dose, 5/26 (19%) participants randomized to 420 mg, and 3/25 
      (12%) of placebo recipients reached the primary endpoint (p = 0.79) among all
      randomized participants, indicating no benefit from silymarin in the intention to
      treat analysis Review by a central pathologist demonstrated that a substantial
      number of participants (49, 63%) did not meet histological entry criteria and
      that fibrosis stage improved most in the placebo treated group, although not
      significantly different from other groups. Silymarin (Legalon®) at the higher
      than customary doses tested in this study is safe and well tolerated. The effect 
      of silymarin in patients with NASH remains inconclusive due to the substantial
      number of patients who entered the study but did not meet entry histological
      criteria, the lack of a statistically significant improvement in NAS of silymarin
      treated patients, and the unanticipated effect of placebo on fibrosis indicate
      the need for additional clinical trials.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov,
      Identifier: NCT00680407.

TI  - Reproductive characteristics are associated with gene-specific promoter
      methylation status in breast cancer.
LID - 926
AB  - Background: Reproductive characteristics are well-established risk factors for
      breast cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully resolved. We
      hypothesized that altered DNA methylation, measured in tumor tissue, could act in
      concert with reproductive factors to impact breast carcinogenesis. Methods: Among
      a population-based sample of women newly diagnosed with first primary breast
      cancer, reproductive history was assessed using a life-course calendar approach
      in an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Methylation-specific polymerase
      chain reaction and Methyl Light assays were used to assess gene promotor
      methylation status (methylated vs. unmethylated) for 13 breast cancer-related
      genes in archived breast tumor tissue. We used case-case unconditional logistic
      regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
      (CIs) for associations with age at menarche and parity (among 855 women), and age
      at first birth and lactation (among a subset of 736 parous women) in association 
      with methylation status. Results: Age at first birth > 27 years, compared with
      < 23 years, was associated with lower odds of methylation of CDH1 (OR = 0.44, 95%
      CI = 0.20–0.99) and TWIST1 (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.28–0.82), and higher odds of
      methylation of BRCA1 (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.14–2.35). Any vs. no lactation was
      associated with higher odds of methylation of the PGR gene promoter (OR = 1.59,
      95% CI = 1.01–2.49). No associations were noted for parity and methylation in any
      of the genes assayed. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that age at first birth,
      lactation and, perhaps age at menarche, are associated with gene promoter
      methylation in breast cancer, and should be confirmed in larger studies with
      robust gene coverage.

LID - 13432
AB  - Certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have the ability to degrade collagen IV,
      a main component of the breast lobular basement membrane. In this cross-sectional
      study, we evaluated expression of MMPs 2, 9, and 14 and collagen IV in LCIS and
      adjacent normal breast tissue among LCIS patients without invasive breast cancer 
      to determine whether expression differed between benign and preinvasive breast
      epithelial tissue. A total of 64 LCIS patients, diagnosed 2004–2014, were
      included; 44 had sufficient paired normal tissue for analysis. Marker epithelial 
      expression was measured using immunofluorescence and quantified using the H score
      (MMPs) or pixel intensity (collagen IV). Associations were evaluated using the
      Spearman correlation or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In LCIS and normal tissue,
      there was a strong correlation between MMP2 and MMP14 expression (LCIS r = 0.69, 
      normal r = 0.81, both P < 0.01). Other pairwise correlations were moderate to
      weak (range: LCIS r = 0.32–0.47, normal r = 0.19–0.32). For all markers,
      expression was lower in LCIS vs. normal tissue (all P ≤ 0.05). In sum,
      collagenase MMPs were expressed in normal breast and LCIS lesions of LCIS
      patients. However, expression was not higher in LCIS compared with normal tissue,
      suggesting collagenase MMP expression does not increase as breast tissue gains a 
      more proliferative phenotype.

TI  - Treatment Patterns Among Adults and Children With Membranous Nephropathy in the
      Cure Glomerulonephropathy Network (CureGN).
PG  - 1725-34
AB  - Introduction: The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical
      Practice Guidelines for Glomerulonephritis recommend that patients with
      membranous nephropathy (MN) at risk for progression receive immunosuppressive
      therapy (IST), usually after 6 months of observation. A cyclophosphamide (CYC) or
      calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)–based regimen is recommended as first-line IST.
      However, the extent to which KDIGO recommendations are adopted in practice
      remains largely unknown. Methods: We evaluated prescribing practice among
      patients with primary MN (diagnosed 2010–2018) enrolled in the Cure
      Glomerulonephropathy Network (CureGN) cohort study. We also evaluated the
      availability of testing for phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) in the contemporary
      era. Results: Among 361 patients (324 adults and 37 children) with MN who were
      IST-naïve at biopsy and had at least 6 months of follow-up, 55% of adults and 58%
      of children initiated IST <6 months after biopsy. Of these, 1 in 5 had no
      indication for (i.e., urine protein-to-creatinine ratio [uPCR] <4 g/g) or an
      apparent contraindication to (i.e., an estimated glomerular filtration rate
      [eGFR] <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2) IST. As first-line IST, half of treated patients
      received either CYC (16% of adults; 0% of children) or a CNI (40% and 46%,
      respectively), whereas 1 in 5 received corticosteroid monotherapy (20% and 27%,
      respectively) and 1 in 6 rituximab (15% and 15%, respectively). More than 80% of 
      surveyed centers had access to PLA2R testing. Conclusion: These findings suggest 
      that providers are not aware of, or lack confidence in, current KDIGO guidelines 
      for MN. Treatment patterns observed in this cohort might critically inform the
      drafting of planned updates to KDIGO guidelines.

TI  - The Diagnosis of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Very Preterm Infants. An
      Evidence-based Approach.
PG  - 751-9
AB  - Rationale: Current diagnostic criteria for bronchopulmonary dysplasia rely
      heavily on the level and duration of oxygen therapy, do not reflect contemporary 
      neonatal care, and do not adequately predict childhood morbidity.Objectives: To
      determine which of 18 prespecified, revised definitions of bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia that variably define disease severity according to the level of
      respiratory support and supplemental oxygen administered at 36 weeks’
      postmenstrual age best predicts death or serious respiratory morbidity through
      18–26 months’ corrected age.Methods: We assessed infants born at less than 32
      weeks of gestation between 2011 and 2015 at 18 centers of the Eunice Kennedy
      Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal
      Research Network.Measurements and Main Results: Of 2,677 infants, 683 (26%) died 
      or developed serious respiratory morbidity. The diagnostic criteria that best
      predicted this outcome defined bronchopulmonary dysplasia according to treatment 
      with the following support at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age, regardless of prior or
      current oxygen therapy: no bronchopulmonary dysplasia, no support (n = 773);
      grade 1, nasal cannula ≤2 L/min (n = 1,038); grade 2, nasal cannula >2 L/min or
      noninvasive positive airway pressure (n = 617); and grade 3, invasive mechanical 
      ventilation (n = 249). These criteria correctly predicted death or serious
      respiratory morbidity in 81% of study infants. Rates of this outcome increased
      stepwise from 10% among infants without bronchopulmonary dysplasia to 77% among
      those with grade 3 disease. A similar gradient (33–79%) was observed for death or
      neurodevelopmental impairment.Conclusions: The definition of bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia that best predicted early childhood morbidity categorized disease
      severity according to the mode of respiratory support administered at 36 weeks’
      postmenstrual age, regardless of supplemental oxygen use.

TI  - What happens after HIV self-testing? Results from a longitudinal cohort of
      Chinese men who have sex with men.
LID - 807
AB  - Background: HIV self-testing (HIVST) is a promising approach to expand HIV
      testing. HIVST is a process in which a person performs an HIV test and interprets
      the result. Negative HIVST results may encourage men who have sex with men (MSM) 
      to use HIV prevention services. The objective of this study was to examine
      behaviors (e.g., facility-based HIV testing, condom use) after a negative HIVST
      test result among Chinese MSM. Methods: We collected data from MSM in eight
      Chinese cities over a 12-month period. This is a secondary analysis of
      longitudinal cohort data collected as part of an intervention trial to increase
      HIV testing. Men completed a survey that described sociodemographic information, 
      sexual behaviors, HIV self-testing, and facility-based HIV testing. Men who
      completed at least one follow-up survey were included in this analysis.
      Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate whether HIVST increased
      subsequent facility-based HIV testing and consistent condom use. Results: We
      included 1219 men. Most men (78.7%) were under 30 years old and had never been
      married (87.0%). 755 (61.9%) men tested for HIV and 593 (49.3%) men self-tested
      during the study period. At baseline, among men who had never been tested for
      HIV, 44.9% (314/699) initiated HIVST during the study period. HIVST was
      associated with subsequent facility-based testing (aOR of 1.87, 95% CI:
      1.47–2.37). HIVST was also associated with subsequent consistent condom use
      (aOR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.13–2.06). Conclusion: HIVST was associated with subsequent
      facility-based HIV testing and consistent condom use. HIVST may enhance uptake of
      related HIV prevention services at facilities, suggesting the need for more
      implementation research.

TI  - Effects of extended powered knee prosthesis stance time via visual feedback on
      gait symmetry of individuals with unilateral amputation: a preliminary study.
LID - 112
AB  - Background: Establishing gait symmetry is a major aim of amputee rehabilitation
      and may be more attainable with powered prostheses. Though, based on previous
      work, we postulate that users transfer a previously-learned motor pattern across 
      devices, limiting the functionality of more advanced prostheses. The objective of
      this study was to preliminarily investigate the effect of increased stance time
      via visual feedback on amputees’ gait symmetry using powered and passive knee
      prostheses. Methods: Five individuals with transfemoral amputation or knee
      disarticulation walked at their self-selected speed on a treadmill. Visual
      feedback was used to promote an increase in the amputated-limb stance time.
      Individuals were fit with a commercially-available powered prosthesis by a
      certified prosthetist and practiced walking during a prior visit. The same
      protocol was completed with a passive knee and powered knee prosthesis on
      separate days. We used repeated-measures, two-way ANOVA (alpha = 0.05) to test
      for significant effects of the feedback and device factors. Our main outcome
      measures were stance time asymmetry, peak anterior-posterior ground reaction
      forces, and peak anterior propulsion asymmetry. Results: Increasing the
      amputated-limb stance time via visual feedback significantly improved the stance 
      time symmetry (p = 0.012) and peak propulsion symmetry (p = 0.036) of individuals
      walking with both prostheses. With the powered knee prosthesis, the highest
      feedback target elicited 36% improvement in stance time symmetry, 22% increase in
      prosthesis-side peak propulsion, and 47% improvement in peak propulsion symmetry 
      compared to a no feedback condition. The changes with feedback were not different
      with the passive prosthesis, and the main effects of device/ prosthesis type were
      not statistically different. However, subject by device interactions were
      significant, indicating individuals did not respond consistently with each device
      (e.g. prosthesis-side propulsion remained comparable to or was greater with the
      powered versus passive prosthesis for different subjects). Overall,
      prosthesis-side peak propulsion averaged across conditions was 31% greater with
      the powered prosthesis and peak propulsion asymmetry improved by 48% with the
      powered prosthesis. Conclusions: Increasing prosthesis-side stance time via
      visual feedback favorably improved individuals’ temporal and propulsive symmetry.
      The powered prosthesis commonly enabled greater propulsion, but individuals
      adapted to each device with varying behavior, requiring further investigation.

TI  - Maternal exposure to outdoor air pollution and congenital limb deficiencies in
      the National Birth Defects Prevention Study.
PG  - 108716
AB  - Background:: Congenital limb deficiencies (CLDs) are a relatively common group of
      birth defects whose etiology is mostly unknown. Recent studies suggest maternal
      air pollution exposure as a potential risk factor. Aim:: To investigate the
      relationship between ambient air pollution exposure during early pregnancy and
      offspring CLDs. Methods:: The study population was identified from the National
      Birth Defects Prevention Study, a population-based multi-center case-control
      study, and consisted of 615 CLD cases and 5,701 controls with due dates during
      1997 through 2006. Daily averages and/or maxima of six criteria air pollutants
      (particulate matter < 2.5 μm [PM2.5], particulate matter < 10 μm [PM10], nitrogen
      dioxide [NO2], sulfur dioxide [SO2], carbon monoxide [CO], and ozone [O3]) were
      averaged over gestational weeks 2–8, as well as for individual weeks during this 
      period, using data from EPA air monitors nearest to the maternal address.
      Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, and study
      center. We estimated aORs for any CLD and CLD subtypes (i.e., transverse,
      longitudinal, and preaxial). Potential confounding by co-pollutant was assessed
      by adjusting for one additional air pollutant. Using the single pollutant model, 
      we further investigated effect measure modification by body mass index, cigarette
      smoking, and folic acid use. Sensitivity analyses were conducted restricting to
      those with a residence closer to an air monitor. Results:: We observed near-null 
      aORs for CLDs per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM10, PM2.5, and O3.
      However, weekly averages of the daily average NO2 and SO2, and daily max NO2,
      SO2, and CO concentrations were associated with increased odds of CLDs. The crude
      ORs ranged from 1.03 to 1.12 per IQR increase in these air pollution
      concentrations, and consistently elevated aORs were observed for CO. Stronger
      associations were observed for SO2 and O3 in subtype analysis (preaxial). In
      co-pollutant adjusted models, associations with CO remained elevated (aORs:
      1.02–1.30); but aORs for SO2 and NO2 became near-null. The aORs for CO remained
      elevated among mothers who lived within 20 km of an air monitor. The aORs varied 
      by maternal BMI, smoking status, and folic acid use. Conclusion:: We observed
      modest associations between CLDs and air pollution exposures during pregnancy,
      including CO, SO2, and NO2, though replication through further epidemiologic
      research is warranted.

TI  - Associations of Leisure‐Time Physical Activity and Television Viewing With Life
      Expectancy Free of Nonfatal Cardiovascular Disease: The ARIC Study.
LID - e012657
AB  - Background: High levels of physical activity have been associated with longer
      life expectancy free of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but specific types of CVD
      and sedentary behavior have not been examined. We examined associations of
      leisure‐time moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (LTPA) and television viewing
      with life expectancy free of 3 types of CVD. Methods and Results: We included
      13 534 participants from the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) cohort.
      We used multistate survival models to estimate associations of LTPA in the past
      year (no LTPA, less than the median, equal to or greater than the median) and
      television viewing (often or very often, sometimes, seldom or rarely) with life
      expectancy at age 50 free of nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and
      heart failure (HF). Over 27 years of follow‐up, 4519 participants developed one
      of the 3 nonfatal CVDs and 5475 deaths occurred. Compared with participants who
      engaged in no LTPA, participants who engaged in LTPA equal to or greater than the
      median had longer life expectancy free of nonfatal CHD (men: 1.5 years [95% CI,
      1.0–2.0]; women: 1.6 years [95% CI, 1.1–2.2]), stroke (men: 1.8 years [95% CI,
      1.2–2.3]; women: 1.8 years [95% CI, 1.3–2.3]), and HF (men: 1.6 years [95% CI,
      1.1–2.1]; women: 1.7 years [95% CI, 1.2–2.2]). Compared with viewing more
      television, watching less television was associated with longer life expectancy
      free of CHD, stroke, and HF (≈0.8 year). Conclusions: Higher levels of LTPA and
      less television viewing were associated with longer life expectancy free of CHD, 
      stroke, and HF. Engaging in LTPA and watching less television may increase the
      number of years lived free of CHD, stroke, and HF.

TI  - Impact of an oral health education intervention among a group of patients with
      eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa).
LID - 29
AB  - Background: It is recognized that eating disorders are serious psychosocial
      illnesses that affect many adolescents and adults. A pre and post survey study
      was developed to assess demographics, oral health knowledge and self-image of
      patients with eating disorders participating in a hospital-based eating disorder 
      clinic using an original oral health education program. The program’s aim is to
      change the self-image and oral health practices of patients with anorexia-binge
      eating/purging (AN-BP) and bulimia nervosa (BN) disorders. Methods: A pre-survey 
      was completed by each study participant prior to attending the three educational 
      sessions over a six-week period. A post survey questionnaire was completed after 
      participation in all the educational presentations. Forty-six patients attended
      all three educational sessions and completed the pre and post-questionnaires.
      Results: Most patients knew in advance that AN-BP and BN behavior can cause
      erosion of the teeth but only 30% knew the most likely location for the erosion
      to occur. But, following completion of the educational interventions, 73%
      answered the location correctly. Patients who reported going to the dentist
      regularly were significantly more likely to respond that their teeth/mouth had a 
      positive effect on how they looked to themselves and to others, their general
      health, and their general happiness. Positive responses to the effect of the
      teeth/mouth on kissing and romantic relationships were also significantly higher 
      for those who go to the dentist regularly compared to those who do not.
      Conclusions: There is a need to further understand AN-BP and BP patients’ oral
      health knowledge and self-image perceptions as it relates to their smile (teeth, 
      mouth) to assist in developing a standardized oral health program for eating
      disorder centers to implement into their daily curricula. A dental team member in
      an interdisciplinary eating disorder treatment team is important. Including an
      oral health education program improves patients’ oral hygiene and oral health
      knowledge, as well as provides a supportive environment to empower the patients
      to take control of their overall oral health. Trial registration: This study was 
      retrospectively registered on April 18, 2019 in ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier:
      NCT03921632.

TI  - Association of Labor With Neonatal Respiratory Outcomes at 36–40 Weeks of
      Gestation.
PG  - 495-501
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate whether labor is associated with lower odds of
      respiratory morbidity among neonates born from 36 to 40 weeks of gestation and to
      assess whether this association varies by gestational age and maternal diabetic
      status. METHODS:: We conducted a secondary analysis of women in the Assessment of
      Perinatal Excellence obstetric cohort who delivered across 25 U.S. hospitals over
      a 3-year period. Women with a singleton liveborn non-anomalous neonate who
      delivered from 36 to 40 weeks of gestation were included in our analysis. Those
      who received antenatal corticosteroids, underwent amniocentesis for fetal lung
      maturity, or did not meet dating criteria were excluded. Our primary outcome was 
      composite neonatal respiratory morbidity, which included respiratory distress
      syndrome, ventilator support, continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal
      death. Maternal characteristics and neonatal outcomes between women who labored
      and those who did not were compared. Multivariable logistic regression models
      were used to evaluate the association between labor and the primary outcome.
      Interactions between labor and diabetes mellitus and labor and gestational age
      were tested. RESULTS:: Our analysis included 63,187 women who underwent labor and
      10,629 who did not. There was no interaction between labor and diabetes mellitus 
      (P=.90). However, there was a significant interaction between labor and
      gestational age (P=.01). In the adjusted model, labor was associated with lower
      odds of neonatal respiratory morbidity compared with no labor for neonates
      delivered from 36–39 weeks of gestation. A 1-week increase in gestational age was
      associated with a 1.2 times increase in the adjusted odds ratio for the neonatal 
      outcome comparing labor and no labor. CONCLUSION:: Labor was associated with
      lower odds of the composite outcome among neonates delivered from 36–39 weeks of 
      gestation. The magnitude of this association varied by gestational age. The
      association was similar for women with or without diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Interventions to promote healthy environments in family child care homes in
      Oklahoma—Happy Healthy Homes: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 541
AB  - Background: Early childhood is a critical period of development. Caregivers,
      including providers of early care and education (ECE), have a substantial
      influence on the health of young children. Family child care homes (FCCHs), which
      are small, licensed ECE businesses operated out of the residences of providers,
      are important settings for promoting child health. However, to date, few
      interventions to promote the health of children have been developed for FCCHs.
      The purpose of this article is to describe the protocol for Happy Healthy Homes, 
      a pilot interdisciplinary, community-based study to improve FCCH environments and
      the health of children in Oklahoma. We describe the development and evaluation of
      two interventions to be tested in a matched attention randomized controlled
      trial: 1) a nutrition intervention aimed at enhancing the nutritional quality of 
      meals served to young children, incorporating the Child and Adult Care Food
      Program best practices, and improving nutritional self-efficacy of providers; and
      2) an environmental intervention aimed at increasing providers’ environmental
      health literacy, self-efficacy for integrated pest management (IPM), and
      awareness of less toxic cleaning practices and FCCH provider cleaning behaviors. 
      Methods: Both interventions are informed by common theoretical principles and are
      matched in attention (i.e., 6 h), format (i.e., two individual 90-min educational
      home visits and a 3-h small group class) and materials (i.e., tool kit of
      educational materials and supplies tailored to the allocated intervention). A
      randomized trial of both interventions is currently underway with 52 FCCH
      providers in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area who participate in the Child and
      Adult Care Food Program. Observed and self-reported measures will be collected at
      baseline, and 3 months and 12 months after baseline measurements. Randomization
      to one of the two interventions will occur after baseline data collection.
      Discussion: This study aims to support FCCH providers in creating healthier FCCH 
      environments for nutrition and environmental health. Successful completion will
      provide critical information about the nutritional quality and the environmental 
      health of children in FCCHs, as well as much needed evidence about the efficacy
      of two community-based interventions to improve the nutrition and environmental
      health of children in home-based ECE settings. Trial registration:
      Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03560050. Retrospectively registered on 23 May 2018.

TI  - The Early Experience With Vedolizumab in the United States.
LID - otz027
AB  - Background: Post-marketing studies of new inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      therapies are needed to establish clinical effectiveness and safety in clinical
      practice. We aimed to describe the U.S. experience with vedolizumab in a
      commercially insured population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort
      study in Quintiles-IMS Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database from May
      2014 to June 2016. We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn disease (CD) and 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous
      enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment
      persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections
      associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to
      identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use. Results: We
      identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 
      56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related
      hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant
      predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first 2 months of
      vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD
      (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: 5.10–153.89). In the 6 months after 
      vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and 5.9% of UC patients had an IBD-related
      surgery. Serious infections were <4%. Conclusions: These data reflect the early
      U.S. experience with vedolizumab. The population-level response to vedolizumab
      therapy is just >50%. Steroids at the time of vedolizumab initiation is the
      strongest predictor of late steroid use in CD. Rates of surgery and serious
      infections are low.

TI  - Myelopreservation with the CDK4/6 inhibitor trilaciclib in patients with
      small-cell lung cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy: a phase Ib/randomized
      phase II trial.
PG  - 1613-21
AB  - Background: Chemotherapy-induced damage of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
      cells (HSPC) causes multi-lineage myelosuppression. Trilaciclib is an intravenous
      CDK4/6 inhibitor in development to proactively preserve HSPC and immune system
      function during chemotherapy (myelopreservation). Preclinically, trilaciclib
      transiently maintains HSPC in G1 arrest and protects them from chemotherapy
      damage, leading to faster hematopoietic recovery and enhanced antitumor immunity.
      Patients and methods: This was a phase Ib (open-label, dose-finding) and phase II
      (randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled) study of the safety, efficacy and
      PK of trilaciclib in combination with etoposide/carboplatin (E/P) therapy for
      treatment-naive extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer patients. Patients
      received trilaciclib or placebo before E/P on days 1–3 of each cycle. Select end 
      points were prespecified to assess the effect of trilaciclib on myelosuppression 
      and antitumor efficacy. Results: A total of 122 patients were enrolled, with 19
      patients in part 1 and 75 patients in part 2 receiving study drug. Improvements
      were seen with trilaciclib in neutrophil, RBC (red blood cell) and lymphocyte
      measures. Safety on trilaciclib+E/P was improved with fewer ≥G3 adverse events
      (AEs) in trilaciclib (50%) versus placebo (83.8%), primarily due to less
      hematological toxicity. No trilaciclib-related ≥G3 AEs occurred. Antitumor
      efficacy assessment for trilaciclib versus placebo, respectively, showed: ORR
      (66.7% versus 56.8%, P = 0.3831); median PFS [6.2 versus 5.0 m; hazard ratio (HR)
      0.71; P = 0.1695]; and OS (10.9 versus 10.6 m; HR 0.87; P = 0.6107). Conclusion: 
      Trilaciclib demonstrated an improvement in the patient’s tolerability of
      chemotherapy as shown by myelopreservation across multiple hematopoietic lineages
      resulting in fewer supportive care interventions and dose reductions, improved
      safety profile, and no detriment to antitumor efficacy. These data demonstrate
      strong proof-of-concept for trilaciclib’s myelopreservation benefits. Clinical
      Trail number: NCT02499770.

TI  - Efficient transplacental IgG transfer in women infected with Zika virus during
      pregnancy.
LID - e0007648
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a newly-identified infectious cause of congenital disease.
      Transplacental transfer of maternal IgG to the fetus plays an important role in
      preventing many neonatal infections. However, antibody transfer may also have
      negative consequences, such as mediating enhancement of flavivirus infections in 
      early life, or trafficking of virus immune complexes to the fetal compartment.
      ZIKV infection produces placental pathology which could lead to impaired IgG
      transfer efficiency as occurs in other maternal infections, such as HIV-1 and
      malaria. In this study, we asked whether ZIKV infection during pregnancy impairs 
      transplacental transfer of IgG. We enrolled pregnant women with fever or rash in 
      a prospective cohort in Vitoria, Brazil during the recent ZIKV epidemic. ZIKV and
      dengue virus (DENV)-specific IgG, ZIKV and DENV neutralizing antibodies, and
      routine vaccine antigen-specific IgG were measured in maternal samples collected 
      around delivery and 20 paired cord blood samples. We concluded that 8 of these
      mothers were infected with ZIKV during pregnancy and 12 were ZIKV-uninfected. The
      magnitude of flavivirus-specific IgG, neutralizing antibody, and vaccine-elicited
      IgG were highly correlated between maternal plasma and infant cord blood in both 
      ZIKV-infected and -uninfected mother-infant pairs. Moreover, there was no
      difference in the magnitude of plasma flavivirus-specific IgG levels between
      mothers and infants regardless of ZIKV infection status. Our data suggests that
      maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy does not impair the efficiency of
      placental transfer of flavivirus-specific, functional, and vaccine-elicited IgG. 
      These findings have implications for the neonatal outomes of maternal ZIKV
      infection and optimal administration of antibody-based ZIKV vaccines and
      therapeutics.

LID - 12179
AB  - Drug resistance to anti-cancer agents is a major concern regarding the successful
      treatment of malignant tumors. Recent studies have suggested that acquired
      resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies such as
      cetuximab are in part caused by genetic alterations in patients with oral
      squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the molecular mechanisms employed by
      other complementary pathways that govern resistance remain unclear. In the
      current study, we performed gene expression profiling combined with extensive
      molecular validation to explore alternative mechanisms driving
      cetuximab-resistance in OSCC cells. Among the genes identified, we discovered
      that a urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)/integrin β1/Src/FAK
      signal circuit converges to regulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation and this pathway
      drives cetuximab-resistance in the absence of EGFR overexpression or acquired
      EGFR activating mutations. Notably, the polyphenolic phytoalexin resveratrol,
      inhibited uPAR expression and consequently the signaling molecules ERK1/2
      downstream of EGFR thus revealing additive effects on promoting OSCC
      cetuximab-sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. The current findings indicate that
      uPAR expression plays a critical role in acquired cetuximab resistance of OSCC
      and that combination therapy with resveratrol may provide an attractive means for
      treating these patients.

TI  - Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Secondary Events Among Acute and Chronic Stable
      Myocardial Infarction Patients: Findings from a Managed Care Database.
PG  - 329-43
AB  - Introduction: Long-term risk for recurrent cardiovascular events among myocardial
      infarction (MI) patients in the acute versus chronic stable phase is not well
      characterized. This study was conducted to evaluate risk factors associated with 
      all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CVD) morbidity and to determine the
      transition period from the acute to chronic stable phase of disease. Methods:
      Administrative claims data from a managed care database (2007–2012) were linked
      to the Social Security Death Index. Kaplan–Meier curves were generated over a
      3-year period. The association between risk factors and clinical endpoints was
      assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. Poisson models estimated the
      ‘transition time’ from acute to chronic phase of disease. Results: On average,
      recurrent cardiovascular event rates were higher among acute MI patients in
      comparison to the chronic MI patients during the first 3 months of follow-up.
      Over the 3-year follow-up period, survival curves became parallel and for some
      outcomes (i.e., acute myocardial infarction and bleeding events), were not
      statistically significantly different between the two groups. In both the acute
      and chronic MI cohorts, diabetes, heart failure, and renal disease were
      consistently statistically significant and positively associated with greater
      risk of death and ischemic events. PAD was consistently associated with increased
      risk among the chronic cohort and composite endpoints among the acute patients.
      Conclusions: Greater understanding of differences in the CVD risk profiles and
      the transition from acute to chronic stable phase may help identify high-risk
      patients and inform clinical risk stratification and long-term disease management
      in MI patients. Funding: Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA. Electronic

TI  - National Study of Childhood Traumatic Events and Adolescent and Adulthood
      Criminal Justice Involvement Risk: Evaluating the Protective Role of Social
      Support from Mentors During Adolescence.
LID - 18m12347
AB  - Objective:: With nearly 11 million people in the United States arrested in 2015, 
      the need to identify antecedent risk factors driving criminal justice involvement
      (CJI) and possible mitigating factors is crucial. This study examines the
      relation between childhood trauma and CJI in adolescence and adulthood and
      assesses how this relation is moderated by mentoring during young adulthood.
      Methods:: We analyzed three waves of data – adolescents, young adults, and adults
      – collected from 1995 to 2008 from 12,288 adolescents who participated in the
      National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a
      nationally-representative study of adolescents in grades seven to 12. We used
      logistic regression to examine how having a close mentor in adolescence moderated
      the relation between criminal justice involvement and nine childhood traumatic
      events: (1) neglect; (2) emotional, (3) physical, and (4) sexual abuse; (5)
      parental incarceration; (6) parental binge drinking; (7) witnessed, (8)
      threatened with, and (9) experienced violence. Results:: Cumulative exposure to
      childhood trauma was associated with CJI in adolescence (adjusted odds ratios
      (AOR) ranging from 1.44–2.69) and adulthood (AORs 1.35–6.39), and parental
      incarceration was consistently one of the, if not the, most strongly associated
      with each form of CJI; the strength of these associations was weakened for those 
      who reported a close mentor compared to those who did not. Conclusions:: This
      study advances the literature regarding trauma and CJI, highlighting the role of 
      social support and mentorship as protective factors for youth who experience
      childhood trauma. We must now look towards interventions aimed at protecting
      vulnerable children from the harms of trauma.

TI  - Public preferences for corporate social responsibility activities in the
      pharmaceutical industry: Empirical evidence from Korea.
LID - e0221321
AB  - Although corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities are common in the
      pharmaceutical industry, there is little empirical evidence on consumer responses
      to CSR practices. We investigated public awareness, preferences, and expectations
      regarding social contribution of the pharmaceutical industry’s CSR activities,
      and identified the factors associated with such activities. We conducted an
      online survey with 1,298 respondents comprising two groups: healthy individuals
      (546) and patients (752). Most respondents (78%) expressed interest in CSR
      activities undertaken by pharmaceutical companies. However, they reported a lack 
      of awareness and experience thereof; only 26.9% were aware of and 7.9% had
      experience with such activities. Among our six CSR activity categories, both
      survey groups showed the highest preference for the “promoting public health”
      (healthy group: 6.34/10; patient group: 6.37/10) and “emergency disaster relief
      support” (6.31 and 6.35) categories. Among sub-categories, activities related to 
      “development of innovative drugs in untreated areas” (6.63 and 6.82) and “support
      for research on new drug development” (6.59 and 6.84) received the highest
      scores. The mean expectation score of social contribution of all CSR activities
      was slightly higher than the mean preference score (6.37 and 6.06, respectively).
      The patient group exhibited a larger difference between the highest and lowest
      expectation scores than the healthy group (1.11 and 0.64, respectively). The
      results of the regression analysis revealed that being a patient, being male, and
      having positive attitudes toward CSR and its expected effects significantly and
      positively affected public preferences regarding CSR activities. We can conclude 
      that CSR activities with high public preference might be an effective strategy to
      improve public awareness of the pharmaceutical industry’s CSR activities.
      Furthermore, the highest preference for CSR activities relates to new drug
      development, indicating that our society believes the pharmaceutical industry’s
      key CSR activity should be to pursue its intrinsic mission: to fulfill unmet
      medical needs by developing new drugs.

TI  - HIV-Specific T Cell Responses Are Highly Stable on Antiretroviral Therapy.
PG  - 9-17
AB  - HIV infection induces a robust T cell response that is sustained by high viremia,
      but falls following the onset of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Relatively little 
      has been reported on the subsequent stability of the HIV-specific T cell response
      in individuals on durable therapy. Such data are critical for powering clinical
      trials testing T cell-based immunotherapies. In a cross-sectional study,
      HIV-specific T cell responses were detectable by ex vivo interferon (IFN)-γ
      ELISpot (average ∼1,100 spot-forming units [SFUs]/106 peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells) in persons living with HIV (PLWH; n = 34), despite median
      durable ART suppression of 5.0 years. No substantial association was detected
      between the summed HIV-specific T cell response and the size of the
      replication-competent HIV reservoir. T cell responses were next measured in
      participants sampled weekly, monthly, or yearly. HIV-specific T cell responses
      were highly stable over the time periods examined; within-individual variation
      ranged from 16% coefficient of variation (CV) for weekly to 27% CV for yearly
      sampling. These data were used to generate power calculations for future
      immunotherapy studies. The stability of the HIV-specific T cell response in
      suppressed PLWH will enable powered studies of small sizes (e.g., n = 6–12),
      facilitating rapid and iterative testing for T cell-based immunotherapies against
      HIV.

TI  - A Mixed-Methods, Randomized Clinical Trial to Examine Feasibility of a
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Management and Diabetes Risk Reduction Intervention for 
      African Americans with Prediabetes.
LID - 3962623
AB  - African Americans have disproportionately high rates of stress-related
      conditions, including diabetes and diabetes-related morbidity. Psychological
      stress may negatively influence engagement in risk-reducing lifestyle changes
      (physical activity and healthy eating) and stress-related physiology that
      increase diabetes risk. This study examined the feasibility of conducting a
      randomized trial comparing a novel mindfulness-based stress management program
      combined with diabetes risk-reduction education versus a conventional diabetes
      risk-reduction education program among African American adults with prediabetes
      and self-reported life stress. Participants were recruited in collaboration with 
      community partners and randomized to the mindfulness-based diabetes
      risk-reduction education program for prediabetes (MPD; n = 38) or the
      conventional diabetes risk-reduction education program for prediabetes (CPD;
      n = 30). The mindfulness components were adapted from the Mindfulness-based
      Stress Reduction Program. The diabetes risk-reduction components were adapted
      from the Power to Prevent Program and the Diabetes Prevention Program. Groups met
      for eight weeks for 2.5 hours, with a half-day retreat and six-monthly boosters. 
      Mixed-methods strategies were used to assess feasibility. Psychological,
      behavioral, and metabolic data were collected before the intervention and at
      three and six months postintervention to examine within-group change and
      feasibility of collecting such data in future clinical efficacy research.
      Participants reported acceptability, credibility, and cultural relevance of the
      intervention components. Enrollment of eligible participants (79%), intervention 
      session attendance (76.5%), retention (90%), and postintervention data collection
      attendance (83%, 82%, and 78%, respectively) demonstrated feasibility, and
      qualitative data provided information to further enhance feasibility in future
      studies. Both groups exhibited an A1C reduction. MPD participants had reductions 
      in perceived stress, BMI, calorie, carbohydrate and fat intake, and increases in 
      spiritual well-being. Considering the high prevalence of diabetes and
      diabetes-related complications in African Americans, these novel findings provide
      promising guidance to develop a larger trial powered to examine efficacy of a
      mindfulness-based stress management and diabetes risk-reduction education program
      for African Americans with prediabetes.

TI  - Using a RE-AIM framework to identify promising practices in National Diabetes
      Prevention Program implementation.
LID - 81
AB  - Background: The National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) is rapidly
      expanding in an effort to help those at high risk of type 2 diabetes prevent or
      delay the disease. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded
      six national organizations to scale and sustain multistate delivery of the
      National DPP lifestyle change intervention (LCI). This study aims to describe
      reach, adoption, and maintenance during the 4-year funding period and to assess
      associations between site-level factors and program effectiveness regarding
      participant attendance and participation duration. Methods: The Reach,
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework was
      used to guide the evaluation from October 2012 to September 2016. Multilevel
      linear regressions were used to examine associations between participant-level
      demographics and site-level strategies and number of sessions attended,
      attendance in months 7–12, and duration of participation. Results: The six funded
      national organizations increased the number of participating sites from 68 in
      2012 to 164 by 2016 across 38 states and enrolled 14,876 eligible participants.
      By September 2016, coverage for the National DPP LCI was secured for 42 private
      insurers and 7 public payers. Nearly 200 employers were recruited to offer the
      LCI on site to their employees. Site-level strategies significantly associated
      with higher overall attendance, attendance in months 7–12, and longer
      participation duration included using self-referral or word of mouth as a
      recruitment strategy, providing non-monetary incentives for participation, and
      using cultural adaptations to address participants’ needs. Sites receiving
      referrals from healthcare providers or health systems also had higher attendance 
      in months 7–12 and longer participation duration. At the participant level,
      better outcomes were achieved among those aged 65+ (vs. 18–44 or 45–64), those
      who were overweight (vs. obesity), those who were non-Hispanic white (vs.
      non-Hispanic black or multiracial/other races), and those eligible based on a
      blood test or history of gestational diabetes mellitus (vs. screening positive on
      a risk test). Conclusions: In a time of rapid dissemination of the National DPP
      LCI the findings of this evaluation can be used to enhance program implementation
      and translate lessons learned to similar organizations and settings. Electronic

TI  - Associations of Physical Activity With Survival and Progression in Metastatic
      Colorectal Cancer: Results From Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance)/SWOG
      80405.
PG  - 2620-31
AB  - PURPOSE: Regular physical activity is associated with reduced risk of recurrence 
      and mortality in patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer. Its influence on 
      patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been largely
      unexplored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study nested 
      in Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance)/SWOG 80405 (ClinicalTrials.gov
      identifier: NCT00265850), a National Cancer Institute–sponsored phase III trial
      of systemic therapy for mCRC. Within 1 month after therapy initiation, patients
      were invited to complete a validated questionnaire that reported average physical
      activity over the previous 2 months. On the basis of responses, we calculated
      metabolic equivalent task (MET) hours per week to quantify physical activity. The
      primary end point of the clinical trial and this companion study was overall
      survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and 
      first grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events. To minimize
      confounding by poor and declining health, we excluded patients who experienced
      progression or died within 60 days of activity assessment and used Cox
      proportional hazards regression analysis to adjust for known prognostic factors, 
      comorbidities, and weight loss. RESULTS: The final cohort included 1,218
      patients. Compared with patients engaged in less than 3 MET hours per week of
      physical activity, patients engaged in 18 or more MET hours per week experienced 
      an adjusted hazard ratio for OS of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.02; PTrend = .06) and 
      for PFS of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99; PTrend = .01). Compared with patients
      engaging in less than 9 MET hours per week, patients engaging in 9 or more MET
      hours per week experienced an adjusted hazard ratio for grade 3 or greater
      treatment-related adverse events of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.86; PTrend < .001).
      CONCLUSION: Among patients with mCRC in Cancer and Leukemia Group B
      (Alliance)/SWOG 80405, association of physical activity with OS was not
      statistically significant. Greater physical activity was associated with longer
      PFS and lower adjusted risk for first grade 3 or greater treatment-related
      adverse events.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents a major health-care problem.
      Understanding patient satisfaction with VTE care is an important health-care
      goal. A national online survey was administered to adults who had experienced a
      recent VTE event. The survey assessed patient satisfaction by: (1) satisfaction
      with VTE care provider; (2) likelihood to recommend VTE provider; and (3)
      satisfaction with communication between VTE care providers. Each question was
      correlated with patient demographics, patient care harms (ie, misdiagnosis, wrong
      treatment), patient beliefs concerning outcomes, and type of anticoagulant
      therapy. Respondents (907) were 52.4 ± 14.4 years, predominantly Caucasian,
      mostly women, and generally had health insurance. Most respondents were satisfied
      with VTE care providers, likely to recommend their VTE provider, and satisfied
      with communication between providers. Dissatisfaction was strongly associated
      with treatment mistakes, a wrong diagnosis or treatment, or delayed treatment. A 
      national sample of VTE patients were generally satisfied with VTE care
      experiences. The VTE care dissatisfaction was strongly associated with perceived 
      mistakes in VTE care. Interventions aimed at reducing, acknowledging, and
      communicating errors could be studied to improve VTE care satisfaction.

AB  - We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Adolescent
      Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions to examine the association between the 
      use of social media sites to find sex partners and recent diagnosis of sexually
      transmitted infections (STIs) among 13- to 24-year-old men who have sex with men 
      and transgender women living with HIV. We used linear regression to determine the
      relationship between the number of STIs and the number of social media sites used
      to find sex partners with each type of sex act included in the analysis.
      Secondary analyses substituted frequency of social media site use for number of
      social media sites. Among 741 participants, for every 1 social media account used
      to find sex partners, there was a 2.53% (95% confidence interval: 0.28-5.54)
      increase in STIs. This association was mediated through condomless receptive anal
      intercourse or condomless insertive anal intercourse but not barrierless oral
      intercourse. Similar but attenuated associations were found when frequency of
      social media site use was substituted for number of social media sites. Future
      research should examine innovative interventions on these social media sites with
      respect for its users.

TI  - Analysis of 75 Candidate SNPs Associated with Acute Rejection in Kidney
      Transplant Recipients: Validation of rs2910164 in MicroRNA MIR146A.
PG  - 1591-602
AB  - Background:: Identifying kidney allograft recipients who are predisposed to acute
      rejection (AR) could allow for optimization of clinical treatment to avoid
      rejection and prolong graft survival. It has been hypothesized that part of this 
      predisposition is caused by the inheritance of specific genetic variants. There
      are many publications reporting a statistically significant association between a
      genetic variant, usually in the form of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
      and AR. However, there are additional publications reporting a lack of this
      association when a different cohort of recipients is analyzed for the same SNP.
      Methods:: In this report we attempted to validate 75 common genetic variants,
      which have been previously reported to be associated with AR, using a large
      kidney allograft recipient cohort of 2,390 European-Americans and 482 African
      Americans. Results:: Of those variants tested, only one variant, rs2910164, which
      alters expression of the microRNA MIR146A, was found to exhibit a significant
      association within the African American cohort. Suggestive variants were found in
      the genes CTLA and TLR4. Discussion:: Our results show that most variants
      previously reported to be associated with AR were not validated in our cohort.
      This shows the importance of validation when reporting associations with complex 
      clinical outcomes such as AR. Additional work will need to be done to understand 
      the role of MIR146A in the risk of AR in kidney allograft recipients.

TI  - Inhibitory Control Deficits Associated with Upregulation of CB1R in the HIV-1 Tat
      Transgenic Mouse Model of Hand.
PG  - 661-78
AB  - In the era of combined antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1 infected individuals are
      living longer lives; however, longevity is met with an increasing number of HIV-1
      associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) diagnoses. The transactivator of
      transcription (Tat) is known to mediate the neurotoxic effects in HAND by acting 
      directly on neurons and also indirectly via its actions on glia. The Go/No-Go
      (GNG) task was used to examine HAND in the Tat transgenic mouse model. The GNG
      task involves subjects discriminating between two stimuli sets in order to
      determine whether or not to inhibit a previously trained response. Data reveal
      inhibitory control deficits in female Tat(+) mice (p = .048) and an upregulation 
      of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1R) in the infralimbic (IL) cortex in the same
      female Tat(+) group (p < .05). A significant negative correlation was noted
      between inhibitory control and IL CB1R expression (r = −.543, p = .045), with
      CB1R expression predicting 30% of the variance of inhibitory control (R2 = .295, 
      p = .045). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in spontaneous
      excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) frequencies in Tat(+) compared to Tat(−) 
      mice (p = .008, across sexes). The increase in sEPSC frequency was significantly 
      attenuated by bath application of PF3845, a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)
      enzyme inhibitor (p < .001). Overall, the GNG task is a viable measure to assess 
      inhibitory control deficits in Tat transgenic mice and results suggest a
      potential therapeutic treatment for the observed deficits with drugs which
      modulate endocannabinoid enzyme activity.Graphical AbstractResults of the
      Go/No-Go operant conditioning task reveal inhibitory control deficits in female
      transgenic Tat(+) mice without significantly affecting males. The demonstrated
      inhibitory control deficits appear to be associated with an upregulation of
      cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1R) in the infralimbic (IL) cortex in the same
      female Tat(+) group.Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this

TI  - Body Mass Index Z-Score Modifies the Association between Added Sugar Intake and
      Arterial Stiffness in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes: The Search Nutrition Ancillary 
      Study.
LID - 1752
AB  - The relationship between added sugar and arterial stiffness in youth with type 1 
      diabetes (T1D) has not been well-described. We used data from the SEARCH for
      Diabetes in Youth Study (SEARCH), an ongoing observational cohort study, to
      determine the association between added sugar and arterial stiffness in
      individuals diagnosed with T1D <20 years of age (n = 1539; mean diabetes duration
      of 7.9 ± 1.9 years). Added sugar intake was assessed by a food frequency
      questionnaire, and arterial stiffness measures included pulse wave velocity (PWV)
      and augmentation index. Separate multivariate linear regression models were used 
      to evaluate the association between added sugar and arterial stiffness. Separate 
      interaction terms were included to test for effect modification by body mass
      index (BMI) z-score and physical activity (PA). Overall, there was no association
      between added sugar and arterial stiffness (P > 0.05); however, the association
      between added sugar and arterial stiffness differed by BMI z-score (P for
      interaction = 0.003). For participants with lower BMI z-scores, added sugar
      intake was positively associated with PWV trunk measurements, whereas there was
      no association for those who had a higher BMI z-score. PA did not significantly
      modify the association between added sugar and arterial stiffness. Further
      research is needed to determine the longitudinal relationship and to confirm that
      obesity differentially affects this association.

TI  - Connecting Youth and Young Adults to Optimize Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence
      (YouTHrive): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - e11502
AB  - Background: Despite intensive efforts to engage people living with HIV in the
      United States, less than half of the youth aged 13 to 24 years achieve viral
      suppression. There is a clear and continued need for innovative behavioral
      programs that support optimizing adherence among young persons with HIV.
      Objective: There are 3 phases of this project. Phase 1 involves conducting focus 
      groups to obtain feedback from youth about an existing technology-based
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence intervention. Phase 2 will be used to
      conduct beta testing with youth to refine and finalize the YouTHrive (YT)
      intervention. Phase 3 is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy
      of the YT intervention among youth living with HIV (YLWH). Methods: In phase 1,
      we will conduct 6 focus groups with approximately 8 youths (aged 15-19 years) and
      young adults (aged 20-24 years), each in 3 US cities to obtain (1) feedback from 
      YLWH about the look and feel and content of an existing adult-focused Web-based
      ART adherence intervention and (2) suggestions for adapting the intervention for 
      YLWH similar to themselves. Phase 2 will involve updating the existing
      intervention to include features and functionality recommended by YLWH in phase
      1; it will conclude with beta testing with 12 participants to gain feedback on
      the overall design and ensure proper functionality and ease of navigation. For
      phase 3, we will enroll 300 YLWH in 6 US cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, New
      York City, Philadelphia, and Tampa) into a 2-arm prospective RCT. Participants
      will be randomized 1:1 to YT intervention or control group. The randomization
      sequence will be stratified by city and use random permuted blocks of sizes 2 and
      4. Participants randomized to the control condition will view a weekly email
      newsletter on topics related to HIV, with the exception of ART adherence, for 5
      months. Participants randomized to the YT intervention condition will be given
      access to the YT site for 5 months. Study assessments will occur at enrollment
      and 5, 8, and 11 months post enrollment. The primary outcome that will be
      assessed is sustained viral load (VL), defined as the proportion of participants 
      in each study arm who have suppressed VL at both the 5- and 11-month assessment; 
      the secondary outcome that will be assessed is suppressed VL at both the 5- and
      11-month assessment between drug-using and nondrug-using participants assigned to
      the YT intervention arm. Results: Participant recruitment began in May 2017 for
      phase 1 of the study. The data collection for aim 3 is anticipated to end in
      April 2020. Conclusions: The efficacy trial of the YT intervention will help to
      fill gaps in understanding the efficacy of mobile interventions to improve ART
      adherence among at-risk populations. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - The development, usability, and reliability of the Electronic Patient Visit
      Assessment (ePVA) for head and neck cancer.
LID - 21
AB  - Background: Annually, over 65,000 persons are diagnosed with head and neck cancer
      in the United States. During treatment, up to 50% of patients become severely
      symptomatic with pain, fatigue, mouth sores, and inability to eat. Long term
      complications are lymphedema, fibrosis, dysphagia, and musculoskeletal
      impairment. Patients’ ability to perform daily activities and to interact
      socially may be impaired, resulting in poor quality of life. A pragmatic,
      clinically useful assessment is needed to ensure early detection and intervention
      for patients to report symptoms and functional limitations over time. We
      developed the Electronic Patient Visit Assessment (ePVA) that enables patients to
      report 42 symptoms related to head and neck cancer and 17 limitations of
      functional status. This manuscript reports (I) the development of the ePVA, (II) 
      the content validity of the ePVA, and (III) the usability and reliability of the 
      ePVA. Methods: Usability was evaluated using the “Think Aloud” technique to guide
      the iterative process to refine the ePVA based on participants’ evaluations.
      After signing the informed consent, 30 participants with head and neck cancer
      completed the ePVA using digital tablet devices while thinking aloud about ease
      of use. All patient conversations were recorded and professionally transcribed.
      Reliability of the ePVA symptom and functional limitation measures was estimated 
      using the Kuder-Richardson test. Convergent validity of the ePVA was evaluated
      using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
      QLQ-C30 global QoL/health scale. Transcribed qualitative data were analyzed using
      directed content analysis approach. Quantitative analyses consisted of
      descriptive statistics and correlation analyses. Results: Among participants, 90%
      strongly agreed or agreed that the ePVA system was easy to use and 80% were very 
      satisfied. Only minor usability problems were reported due to formatting and
      software “bugs”. Reporting of usability problems decreased in frequency over the 
      study period and no usability problems were reported by the last 3 participants
      who completed the ePVA. Based on participants’ suggestions during the iterative
      process, refinement of the ePVA included increased touch sensitivity of the touch
      screen technology and customized error messages to improve ease of use. The ePVA 
      also recorded patient reported symptoms (mouth symptoms: 93%, fibrosis: 60%,
      fatigue: 60%). The ePVA demonstrated acceptable reliability (alpha =0.82–0.85)
      and convergent validity (ePVA total number of reported symptoms and function
      limitations was negatively correlated with EORTC QLQ-C30 global QOL/health scale:
      r=−0.55038, P<0.01). Conclusions: The ePVA was rigorously developed, accepted by 
      patients with satisfaction, and demonstrated acceptable reliability and
      convergent validity. Future research will use data generated by the ePVA to
      determine the impact of symptom trajectories on functional status, treatment
      interruptions and terminations, and health resource use in head and neck cancer.

TI  - Quality of dietary fat and genetic risk of type 2 diabetes: individual
      participant data meta-analysis.
LID - l4292
AB  - Objective: To investigate whether the genetic burden of type 2 diabetes modifies 
      the association between the quality of dietary fat and the incidence of type 2
      diabetes. Design: Individual participant data meta-analysis. Data sources:
      Eligible prospective cohort studies were systematically sourced from studies
      published between January 1970 and February 2017 through electronic searches in
      major medical databases (Medline, Embase, and Scopus) and discussion with
      investigators. Review methods: Data from cohort studies or multicohort consortia 
      with available genome-wide genetic data and information about the quality of
      dietary fat and the incidence of type 2 diabetes in participants of European
      descent was sought. Prospective cohorts that had accrued five or more years of
      follow-up were included. The type 2 diabetes genetic risk profile was
      characterized by a 68-variant polygenic risk score weighted by published effect
      sizes. Diet was recorded by using validated cohort-specific dietary assessment
      tools. Outcome measures were summary adjusted hazard ratios of incident type 2
      diabetes for polygenic risk score, isocaloric replacement of carbohydrate
      (refined starch and sugars) with types of fat, and the interaction of types of
      fat with polygenic risk score. Results: Of 102 305 participants from 15
      prospective cohort studies, 20 015 type 2 diabetes cases were documented after a 
      median follow-up of 12 years (interquartile range 9.4-14.2). The hazard ratio of 
      type 2 diabetes per increment of 10 risk alleles in the polygenic risk score was 
      1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.54 to 1.75, I2=7.1%, τ2=0.003). The increase of
      polyunsaturated fat and total omega 6 polyunsaturated fat intake in place of
      carbohydrate was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, with hazard
      ratios of 0.90 (0.82 to 0.98, I2=18.0%, τ2=0.006; per 5% of energy) and 0.99
      (0.97 to 1.00, I2=58.8%, τ2=0.001; per increment of 1 g/d), respectively.
      Increasing monounsaturated fat in place of carbohydrate was associated with a
      higher risk of type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.01
      to 1.19, I2=25.9%, τ2=0.006; per 5% of energy). Evidence of small study effects
      was detected for the overall association of polyunsaturated fat with the risk of 
      type 2 diabetes, but not for the omega 6 polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated 
      fat associations. Significant interactions between dietary fat and polygenic risk
      score on the risk of type 2 diabetes (P>0.05 for interaction) were not observed. 
      Conclusions: These data indicate that genetic burden and the quality of dietary
      fat are each associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The findings do
      not support tailoring recommendations on the quality of dietary fat to individual
      type 2 diabetes genetic risk profiles for the primary prevention of type 2
      diabetes, and suggest that dietary fat is associated with the risk of type 2
      diabetes across the spectrum of type 2 diabetes genetic risk.

TI  - Randomized Trial of Standard Adjuvant Chemotherapy Regimens Versus Capecitabine
      in Older Women With Early Breast Cancer: 10-Year Update of the CALGB 49907 Trial.
PG  - 2338-48
AB  - PURPOSE: Older women with breast cancer remain under-represented in clinical
      trials. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 49907 trial focused on women age 65 years
      and older. We previously reported the primary analysis after a median follow-up
      of 2.4 years. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy showed significant improvements in
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival compared with capecitabine.
      We now update results at a median follow-up of 11.4 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Patients age 65 years or older with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to
      either standard adjuvant chemotherapy (physician’s choice of either
      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil or cyclophosphamide and
      doxorubicin) or capecitabine. An adaptive Bayesian design was used to determine
      sample size and test noninferiority of capecitabine. The primary end point was
      RFS. RESULTS: The design stopped accrual with 633 patients at its first sample
      size assessment. RFS remains significantly longer for patients treated with
      standard chemotherapy. At 10 years, in patients treated with standard
      chemotherapy versus capecitabine, the RFS rates were 56% and 50%, respectively
      (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; P = .03); breast cancer–specific survival rates were
      88% and 82%, respectively (HR, 0.62; P = .03); and overall survival rates were
      62% and 56%, respectively (HR, 0.84; P = .16). With longer follow-up, standard
      chemotherapy remains superior to capecitabine among hormone receptor–negative
      patients (HR, 0.66; P = .02), but not among hormone receptor–positive patients
      (HR, 0.89; P = .43). Overall, 43.9% of patients have died (13.1% from breast
      cancer, 16.4% from causes other than breast cancer, and 14.1% from unknown
      causes). Second nonbreast cancers occurred in 14.1% of patients. CONCLUSION: With
      longer follow-up, RFS remains superior for standard adjuvant chemotherapy versus 
      capecitabine, especially in patients with hormone receptor–negative disease.
      Competing risks in this older population dilute overall survival benefits.

TI  - In‐Hospital and Postdischarge Mortality Among Patients With Acute Decompensated
      Heart Failure Hospitalizations Ending on the Weekend Versus Weekday: The ARIC
      Study Community Surveillance.
LID - e011631
AB  - Background: Hospital staffing is usually reduced on weekends, potentially
      impacting inpatient care and postdischarge coordination of care for patients with
      acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, investigations of in‐hospital 
      mortality on the weekend versus weekday, and post‐hospital outcomes of weekend
      versus weekday discharge are scarce. Methods and Results: Hospitalizations for
      ADHF were sampled by stratified design from 4 US areas by the Community
      Surveillance component of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study.
      ADHF was classified by a standardized computer algorithm and physician review of 
      the medical records. Discharges or deaths on Saturday, Sunday, or national
      holidays were considered to occur on the “weekend.” In‐hospital mortality was
      compared between hospitalizations ending on a weekend versus weekday.
      Post‐hospital (28‐day) mortality was compared among patients discharged alive on 
      a weekend versus weekday. From 2005 to 2014, 39 699 weighted ADHF
      hospitalizations were identified (19% terminating on a weekend). Demographics,
      comorbidities, length of stay, and guideline‐directed therapies were similar for 
      patients with hospitalizations ending on a weekend versus weekday. In‐hospital
      death doubled on the weekend compared with weekday (12% versus 6%) and was not
      attenuated by adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio, 2.37; 95% CI,
      1.93–2.91). There was no association between weekend discharge and 28‐day
      mortality among patients discharged alive. Conclusions: The risk of in‐hospital
      death among patients admitted with ADHF appears to be doubled on the weekends
      when hospital staffing is usually reduced. However, among patients discharged
      alive, hospital discharge on a weekend is not adversely associated with
      mortality.

TI  - Who Is Exposed to E-Cigarette Advertising and Where? Differences between
      Adolescents, Young Adults and Older Adults.
LID - 2533
AB  - Little is known about differences between adolescents’ and adults’ exposure to
      e-cigarette advertising in various media channels, such as retail establishments,
      print, television, radio, and digital marketing. We examined the exposure to
      e-cigarette advertising in these channels amongst adolescents (13–17), young
      adults (18–25), and older adults (26+). Adolescents (N = 1124), young adults (N =
      809), and adults (N = 4186) were recruited through two nationally representative 
      phone surveys from 2014–2015. Lifetime e-cigarette advertising exposure was
      prevalent (84.5%). Overall, older adult males and older adult cigarette smokers
      reported the highest exposure to e-cigarette advertising (p < 0.001). Television 
      was the largest source of exposure for all age groups. Adolescents and young
      adults had higher odds than older adults of exposure through television and
      digital marketing. However, adolescents had lower odds than young adults and
      older adults of exposure through retailers and print media. Although e-cigarette 
      advertising appears to be reaching the intended audience of adult smokers,
      vulnerable populations are being exposed at high rates via television and digital
      marketing. Regulations aimed at curbing exposure through these media channels are
      needed, as are counter advertising and prevention campaigns.

TI  - Elevated Microparticle Tissue Factor Activity Differentiates Patients With Venous
      Thromboembolism in Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibody Vasculitis.
PG  - 1617-29
AB  - Introduction: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening complication of 
      anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) vasculitis whose mechanism
      remains incompletely elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that elevated
      microparticle tissue factor activity (MPTFa) or anti-plasminogen antibodies
      (anti-Plg) may identify patients at risk for VTE. Methods: In this prospective
      study, patients were enrolled during active disease and followed longitudinally. 
      Twelve patients who experienced a VTE (VTEpos) were compared with patients
      without VTE (VTEneg, n = 29) and healthy controls (HC, n = 70). MPTFa, anti-Plg, 
      interleukin-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), D-dimer, serum
      creatinine, and serum albumin were assessed. Fisher’s exact tests and Wilcoxon
      tests compared categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Cox regression
      for time to VTE or last follow-up was performed. Results: VTEpos patients had
      higher MPTFa (peak median = 14.0, interquartile range = 4.3–36.6) than HC (0,
      0–3.5) and VTEneg patients (0, 0–1.4). In time-to-event analysis, MPTFa was
      associated with VTE when measured during both active disease (hazard ratio [HR]; 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04; 1.01–1.08) and remission (1.4; 1.11–1.77).
      Anti-Plg during remission was also associated with VTE (1.17; 1.03–1.33). Each
      g/dl decrease of serum albumin was associated with a 4-fold increase in VTE risk 
      (4.4; 1.5–12.9). Adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
      anti-Plg during remission remained significantly associated with VTE. Conclusion:
      Elevated MPTFa and increased anti-Plg in remission are strong indicators of VTE
      independent of renal function. Association of anti-Plg during remission with VTE 
      implies hypercoagulability even during disease quiescence. Hypoalbuminemia
      strongly portends VTE risk, which is a novel finding in ANCA vasculitis. A
      thrombotic signature would allow improved management of patients to minimize VTE 
      risk and complications of anticoagulation.

TI  - State-Level and County-Level Estimates of Health Care Costs Associated with Food 
      Insecurity.
LID - E90
AB  - Introduction: Food insecurity, or uncertain access to food because of limited
      financial resources, is associated with higher health care expenditures. However,
      both food insecurity prevalence and health care spending vary widely in the
      United States. To inform public policy, we estimated state-level and county-level
      health care expenditures associated with food insecurity. Methods: We used linked
      2011–2013 National Health Interview Survey/Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data 
      (NHIS/MEPS) data to estimate average health care costs associated with food
      insecurity, Map the Meal Gap data to estimate state-level and county-level food
      insecurity prevalence (current though 2016), and Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care
      data to account for local variation in health care prices and intensity of use.
      We used targeted maximum likelihood estimation to estimate health care costs
      associated with food insecurity, separately for adults and children, adjusting
      for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Among NHIS/MEPS participants,
      10,054 adults and 3,871 children met inclusion criteria. Model estimates
      indicated that food insecure adults had annual health care expenditures that were
      $1,834 (95% confidence interval [CI], $1,073–$2,595, P < .001) higher than food
      secure adults. For children, estimates were $80 higher, but this finding was not 
      significant (95% CI, −$171 to $329, P = .53). The median annual health care cost 
      associated with food insecurity was $687,041,000 (25th percentile, $239,675,000; 
      75th percentile, $1,140,291,000). The median annual county-level health care cost
      associated with food insecurity was $4,433,000 (25th percentile, $1,774,000; 75th
      percentile, $11,267,000). Cost variability was related primarily to food
      insecurity prevalence. Conclusions: Health care expenditures associated with food
      insecurity vary substantially across states and counties. Food insecurity
      policies may be important mechanisms to contain health care expenditures.

TI  - Genotype‐phenotype relationships in mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I):
      Insights from the International MPS I Registry.
PG  - 281-9
AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder
      resulting from pathogenic variants in the α‐L‐iduronidase (IDUA) gene. Clinical
      phenotypes range from severe (Hurler syndrome) to attenuated (Hurler‐Scheie and
      Scheie syndromes) and vary in age of onset, severity, and rate of progression.
      Defining the phenotype at diagnosis is essential for disease management. To date,
      no systematic analysis of genotype‐phenotype correlation in large MPS I cohorts
      have been performed. Understanding genotype‐phenotype is critical now that
      newborn screening for MPS I is being implemented. Data from 538 patients from the
      MPS I Registry (380 severe, 158 attenuated) who had 2 IDUA alleles identified
      were examined. In the 1076 alleles identified, 148 pathogenic variants were
      reported; of those, 75 were unique. Of the 538 genotypes, 147 (27%) were unique; 
      40% of patients with attenuated and 22% of patients with severe MPS I had unique 
      genotypes. About 67.6% of severe patients had genotypes where both variants
      identified are predicted to severely disrupt protein/gene function and 96.1% of
      attenuated patients had at least one missense or intronic variant. This dataset
      illustrates a close genotype/phenotype correlation in MPS I but the presence of
      unique IDUA missense variants remains a challenge for disease prediction.

TI  - Measuring Adherence: A Proof of Concept Study for Multiple Medications for
      Chronic Conditions in Alternative Payment Models.
LID - 81
AB  - Adherence to renin angiotensin system antagonists (RASA), non-insulin diabetes
      medications (NIDM) and statins has been included in the Medicare Star Ratings
      program since 2012. The long-term use of these measures emphasizes adherence to a
      limited number of chronic medications and may present opportunities for Part D
      plan sponsors to misuse the measures to influence their Medicare Part D Star
      Rating. It also does not capture the adherence needs of high-risk patients with
      multiple chronic conditions. The objective of this study was to describe the
      development of a new measure to capture adherence to multiple medications for
      chronic conditions (MMCC). The MMCC measure captures adherence to 71 different
      therapeutic categories of medication and was constructed using North Carolina
      Medicaid prescription claims data from 2015 to 2017. This measure was validated
      against the existing RASA, NIDM and statin adherence measures. This new measure
      was highly correlated with Star Rating measures, captured a greater number of
      eligible patients than these existing measures and had a lower proportion of
      patients meet the adherence threshold than the existing Star Ratings adherence
      measures. There is an opportunity to develop new measures, which include
      adherence to multiple medications in populations with multiple chronic
      conditions.

TI  - Trends in prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors from 2002 to 2012 among youth
      early in the course of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The SEARCH for Diabetes in
      Youth Study.
PG  - 693-701
AB  - Background:: Given diabetes is an important risk factor for cardiovascular
      disease (CVD), we examined temporal trends in CVD risk factors by comparing youth
      recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) from 2002
      through 2012. Methods:: The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study identified youth
      with diagnosed T1D (n = 3954) and T2D (n = 706) from 2002 to 2012. CVD risk
      factors were defined using the modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for
      metabolic syndrome: (a) hypertension; (b) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      ≤40 mg/dL; (c) triglycerides ≥110 mg/dL; and (d) waist circumference (WC) >90th
      percentile. Prevalence of CVD risk factors, stratified by diagnosis year and
      diabetes type, was reported. Univariate and multivariate logistic models and
      Poisson regression were fit to estimate the prevalence trends for CVD risk
      factors individually and in clusters (≥2 risk factors). Results:: The prevalence 
      of ≥2 CVD risk factors was higher in youth with T2D than with T1D at each
      incident year, but the prevalence of ≥2 risk factors did not change across
      diagnosis years among T1D or T2D participants. The number of CVD risk factors did
      not change significantly in T1D participants, but increased at an annual rate of 
      1.38% in T2D participants. The prevalence of hypertension decreased in T1D
      participants, and high WC increased in T2D participants. Conclusion:: The
      increase in number of CVD risk factors including large WC among youth with T2D
      suggests a need for early intervention to address these CVD risk factors. Further
      study is needed to examine longitudinal associations between diabetes and CVD.

TI  - Discriminative Accuracy of FEV1:FVC Thresholds for COPD-Related Hospitalization
      and Mortality.
PG  - 2438-47
AB  - Question: What is the discriminative accuracy of various thresholds for the ratio
      of the forced expiratory volume in the first second to the forced vital capacity 
      (FEV1:FVC) for predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related
      hospitalization and mortality? Findings: Among 24 207 participants from 4 US
      general population–based cohorts, the optimal fixed threshold for discriminating 
      COPD-related events was 0.71 (C statistic for the optimal fixed threshold,
      0.696). The discriminative accuracy of the 0.71 threshold was not significantly
      different than that of the 0.70 threshold (difference, 0.001) but it was more
      accurate than a lower-limit-of-normal threshold derived from population-based
      reference equations (difference between the optimal ratio threshold vs the model 
      using the LLN threshold, 0.034). The 0.70 threshold provided optimal
      discrimination in a subgroup analysis of ever smokers and in adjusted models.
      Meaning: These results support the use of FEV1:FVC less than 0.70 to identify
      individuals at risk of clinically significant COPD.

      bioabsorbable implant (Latera) to support the lateral nasal wall. This study
      aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) with sham control. Methods: In this prospective,
      multicenter, single‐blinded RCT, 137 patients from 10 clinics were randomized
      into 2 arms: treatment arm (70 patients) and sham control arm (67 patients).
      Outcome measures were followed through 3 months after the procedure. The primary 
      endpoint was the responder rate (percentage of patients with reduction in
      clinical severity by ≥1 category or ≥20% reduction in Nasal Obstruction Symptom
      Evaluation [NOSE] score). Results: Before the procedure, there were no
      statistically significant differences in patient demographics and nasal
      obstruction symptom measures between the 2 arms. Three months after the
      procedure, responder rate was significantly higher for the treatment arm compared
      to the control (82.5% vs 54.7%, p = 0.001). Patients in the treatment arm also
      had a significantly greater decrease in NOSE score (–42.4 ± 23.4 vs –22.7 ± 27.9,
      p < 0.0001) and significantly lower visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (–39.0 ±
      29.7 vs –13.3 ± 30.0, p < 0.0001) than the sham control arm. Seventeen patients
      reported 19 procedure/implant‐related adverse events, all of which resolved with 
      no clinical sequelae. Conclusion: Our study shows the safety and effectiveness of
      the bioabsorbable implant in reducing patients’ nasal obstruction symptoms.

TI  - Impact of Travel Time on Health Care Costs and Resource Use by Phase of Care for 
      Older Patients With Cancer.
PG  - 1935-45
AB  - PURPOSE: Many community cancer clinics closed between 2008 and 2016, with
      additional closings potentially expected. Limited data exist on the impact of
      travel time on health care costs and resource use. METHODS: This retrospective
      cohort study (2012 to 2015) evaluated travel time to cancer care site for
      Medicare beneficiaries age 65 years or older in the southeastern United States.
      The primary outcome was Medicare spending by phase of care (ie, initial,
      survivorship, end of life). Secondary outcomes included patient cost
      responsibility and resource use measured by hospitalization rates, intensive care
      unit admissions, and chemotherapy-related hospitalization rates. Hierarchical
      linear models with patients clustered within cancer care site (CCS) were used to 
      determine the effects of travel time on average monthly phase-specific Medicare
      spending and patient cost responsibility. RESULTS: Median travel time was 32
      (interquartile range, 18-59) minutes for the 23,382 included Medicare
      beneficiaries, with 24% of patients traveling longer than 1 hour to their CCS.
      During the initial phase of care, Medicare spending was 14% higher and patient
      cost responsibility was 10% higher for patients traveling longer than 1 hour than
      those traveling 30 minutes or less. Hospitalization rates were 4% to 13% higher
      for patients traveling longer than 1 hour versus 30 minutes or less in the
      initial (61 v 54), survivorship (27 v 26), and end-of-life (310 v 286) phases of 
      care (all P < .05). Most patients traveling longer than 1 hour were hospitalized 
      at a local hospital rather than at their CCS, whereas the converse was true for
      patients traveling 30 minutes or less. CONCLUSION: As health care locations
      close, patients living farther from treatment sites may experience more limited
      access to care, and health care spending could increase for patients and
      Medicare.

TI  - The Association of Changes in Heart Failure Treatment with Patients’ Health
      Status: Real-World Evidence from CHAMP-HF.
PG  - 615-25
AB  - Background:: One of the primary goals of treatment for HFrEF is to improve
      patients’ health status; their symptoms, function, and quality of life, which has
      even been proposed as a performance measure for quality. We examined whether
      physician-led changes in HFrEF medications improved patients’ health status to
      highlight the opportunity for clinicians to improve patients’ health status.
      Objectives:: To describe the association between changes in patients’ medical
      regimens with change in the health status of outpatients with heart failure and
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Methods:: Using a multi-center, observational 
      outpatient registry of patients with HFrEF, we examined the association of any
      change in HFrEF medications with 3-month change in health status, as measured by 
      the 12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Scale
      (KCCQ-OS). Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted (25 clinical characteristics,
      baseline health status) results were obtained using hierarchical linear
      regression models. Results:: Among 3,313 outpatients with HFrEF from 140 centers,
      21.9% had a change in their HFrEF medications during routine clinical care. At 3 
      months, 23.7% and 46.4% experienced clinically meaningfully worse (≥ 5-point
      decrease) and improved (≥ 5-point increase) KCCQ-OS scores. The 3-month median
      change in KCCQ-OS for patients whose HFrEF medical regimen was changed was
      significantly larger (7.3 points [IQR: −3.1, 20.8]) than for patients whose
      medications were not changed (3.1 points [IQR:−4.7, 12.5], adjusted difference = 
      3.0 points (95% CI: 1.4, 4.6; p<0.001)). The proportion with a very large
      clinical improvement (≥20 points) was 26% in those whose medications were
      adjusted, vs. 14% when they were not. Conclusions:: In routine care of patients
      with HFrEF, changes in HFrEF medications were associated with significant
      improvements in patients’ health status. Health status-based performance measures
      can quantify the benefits of titrating medicines in HFrEF patients.

TI  - Pain coping skills training for African Americans with osteoarthritis: results of
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1297-307
AB  - African Americans bear a disproportionate burden of osteoarthritis (OA), but they
      have been underrepresented in trials of behavioral interventions for pain. This
      trial examined a culturally tailored pain coping skills training (CST) program,
      compared to a wait list control group, among 248 African Americans with knee or
      hip OA. The pain CST program involved 11 telephone-based sessions over 3 months. 
      Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (primary), and 9 months, and
      included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC) pain subscale (primary outcome), WOMAC total score and function subscale,
      PROMIS Pain Interference, Short-Form 12 Mental and Physical Composite Subscales, 
      Coping Strategies Questionnaire—Total Coping Attempts, Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-8, Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale, and Patient
      Global Impression of Arthritis Symptom Change. Linear mixed models were fit for
      all outcomes. There were no significant between-group differences in WOMAC pain
      score at 3 months (20.63 [95% confidence interval 21.45, 0.18]; P = 0.128) or 9
      months (20.84 [95% confidence interval 21.73, 0.06]; P = 0.068). Among secondary 
      outcomes, at 3 months, there were significant differences, in favor of the CST
      group, for Coping Strategies Questionnaire Total Coping Attempts, Pain
      Catastrophizing Scale, Arthritis Self-Efficacy, and Patient Global Impression of 
      Arthritis Symptom Change (P < 0.01). Coping Strategies Questionnaire Total Coping
      Attempts, Arthritis Self-Efficacy, and Patient Global Assessment Change were also
      significantly improved at 9 months in the CST group, compared with wait list (P <
      0.01). The culturally tailored pain CST program did not significantly reduce pain
      severity but did improve key measures of pain coping and perceived ability to
      manage pain among African Americans with OA.

TI  - Association of Lupus Nephritis With Coronary Artery Disease by ISN/RPS
      Classification: Results From a Large Real‐world Lupus Population.
PG  - 244-50
AB  - Objective: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at an increased
      risk for developing coronary artery disease (CAD). Several studies suggest that
      the presence of lupus nephritis (LN) is independently associated with CAD. The
      purpose of our study was to assess whether the presence of LN is independently
      associated with CAD in our patient population and whether this association varies
      by class of LN. Methods: A retrospective cross‐sectional analysis was performed
      using medical records of patients 18 years and older with SLE at University of
      North Carolina Hospitals from April 4, 2014, to December 31, 2017. Subjects were 
      identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9)
      and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD‐10) codes
      specific for SLE. LN class was defined by International Society of
      Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification. CAD was the outcome 
      of interest. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Our sample consisted of 3732 patients with
      SLE, of whom 598 (16%) had LN and 537 (14%) had CAD. When adjusting for
      demographics and factors associated with CAD and LN, the odds of having CAD were 
      significantly higher for patients with SLE and LN compared with patients without 
      LN (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.07‐2.02; P = 0.017). Controlling for these factors, class
      III LN (OR 1.98; 95% CI 0.95‐4.12; P = 0.069) and class III/V LN (OR 2.23; 95% CI
      1.09‐4.62; P = 0.028) were very strongly associated with CAD in subjects with LN 
      compared with subjects without LN. Conclusion: We confirm the observations of
      previous studies that LN is significantly associated with CAD. Our study is the
      first to show the association between CAD and specific classes of LN.

TI  - Historical roots of implicit bias in slavery.
PG  - 11693-8
AB  - Geographic variation in implicit bias is associated with multiple racial
      disparities in life outcomes. We investigated the historical roots of
      geographical differences in implicit bias by comparing average levels of implicit
      bias with the number of slaves in those areas in 1860. Counties and states more
      dependent on slavery in 1860 displayed higher pro-White implicit bias today among
      White residents and less pro-White bias among Black residents. Mediation analyses
      suggest that historical oppression may be transmitted into contemporary biases
      through structural inequalities, including disparities in poverty and upward
      mobility. Given the importance of contextual factors, efforts to reduce
      unintended discrimination might focus on modifying social environments that cue
      implicit biases in the minds of individuals.

      Consortium.
PG  - 3189-99
AB  - Objective: To describe snacking characteristics and patterns in children and
      examine associations with diet quality and BMI. Design: Children’s weight and
      height were measured. Participants/adult proxies completed multiple 24-hour
      dietary recalls. Snack occasions were self-identified. Snack patterns were
      derived for each sample using exploratory factor analysis. Associations of
      snacking characteristics and patterns with Health Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010)
      score and body mass index (BMI) were examined using multivariable linear
      regression models. Setting: Childhood Obesity Prevention and Treatment Research
      (COPTR) Consortium, United States: NET-Works, GROW, GOALS, and IMPACT studies.
      Subjects: Predominantly low-income, racial/ethnic minorities: NET-Works (n 534
      2–4-year-olds); GROW (n 610 3–5-year-olds); GOALS (n 241 7–11-year-olds); and
      IMPACT (n 360 10–13-year-olds). Results: Two snack patterns were derived for
      three studies, a meal-like pattern and beverage pattern. The IMPACT study had a
      similar meal-like pattern and a dairy/grains pattern. A positive association was 
      observed between meal-like pattern adherence and HEI-2010 score
      (p-for-trend<0.01) and snack occasion frequency and HEI-2010 score (β-coefficient
      [95% CI]: NET-Works: 0.14 [0.04, 0.23], GROW: 0.12 [0.02, 0.21]) among younger
      children. A preference for snacking while using a screen was inversely associated
      with HEI-2010 score in all studies except IMPACT (β-coefficient [95% CI]:
      NET-Works: −3.15 [−5.37, −0.92], GROW: −2.44 [−4.27, −0.61], GOALS: −5.80 [−8.74,
      −2.86]). Associations with BMI were almost all null. Conclusions: Meal-like and
      beverage patterns described most children’s snack intake, though patterns for
      non-Hispanic Blacks or adolescents may differ. Diets of 2–5-year-olds may benefit
      from frequent meal-like pattern snack consumption, and diets of all children may 
      benefit from decreasing screen use during eating occasions.

TI  - Text Messaging for Disease Monitoring in Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome.
PG  - 1066-74
AB  - Introduction: There is limited information on effective disease monitoring for
      prompt interventions in childhood nephrotic syndrome. We examined the feasibility
      and effectiveness of a novel text messaging system (SMS) for disease monitoring
      in a multicenter, prospective study. Methods: A total of 127 patients <19 years
      with incident nephrotic syndrome were enrolled in the ongoing Nephrotic Syndrome 
      Study Network between June 2015 and March 2018. Text messages soliciting home
      urine protein results, symptoms, and medication adherence were sent to a
      designated caregiver (n = 116) or adolescent patient (n = 3). Participants
      responded by texting. Feasibility of SMS was assessed by SMS adoption, retention,
      and engagement, and concordance between participant-reported results and
      laboratory/clinician assessments. The number of disease relapses and
      time-to-remission data captured by SMS were compared with data collected by
      conventional visits. Results: A total of 119 of 127 (94%) patients agreed to SMS 
      monitoring. Retention rate was 94%, with a median follow-up of 360 days
      (interquartile range [IQR] 353–362). Overall engagement was high, with a median
      response rate of 87% (IQR, 68–97). Concordance between SMS-captured home urine
      protein results and edema status with same-day in-person study visit was
      excellent (kappa values 0.88 and 0.92, respectively). SMS detected a total of 108
      relapse events compared with 41 events captured by scheduled visits. Median time 
      to remission after enrollment was 22 days as captured by SMS versus 50 days as
      captured by scheduled visits. Conclusion: SMS was well accepted by caregivers and
      adolescent patients and reliably captured nephrotic syndrome disease activity
      between clinic visits. Additional studies are needed to explore the impact of SMS
      on disease outcomes.

TI  - Animal production, insecticide use and self-reported symptoms and diagnoses of
      COPD, including chronic bronchitis, in the Agricultural Health Study.
PG  - 764-72
AB  - Background:: Occupational exposure to animal production is associated with
      chronic bronchitis symptoms; however, few studies consider associations with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We estimated associations between
      animal production activities and prevalence of self-reported COPD among farmers
      in the Agricultural Health Study. Methods:: During a 2005–2010 interview, farmers
      self-reported information about: their operations (i.e., size, type, number of
      animals, insecticide use), respiratory symptoms, and COPD diagnoses (i.e., COPD, 
      chronic bronchitis, emphysema). Operations were classified as small or
      medium/large based on regulatory definitions. Farmers were classified as having a
      COPD diagnosis, chronic bronchitis symptoms (cough and phlegm for ≥3 months
      during 2 consecutive years), or both. Polytomous logistic regression was used to 
      estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results:: Of 22,491 
      participating farmers (median age: 59years), 922 (4%) reported a COPD diagnosis
      only, 254 (1%) reported a diagnosis and symptoms, and 962 (4%) reported symptoms 
      only. Compared to raising no commercial animals, raising animals on a
      medium/large operation was positively associated with chronic bronchitis symptoms
      with (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.18) and withouta diagnosis (OR: 1.69; 95% CI:
      1.42, 2.01). Ever use of multiple organophosphates, carbaryl, lindane, and
      permethrin were positively associated with chronic bronchitis symptoms.
      Conclusion:: Animal production work, including insecticide use, was positively
      associated with chronic bronchitis symptoms; but not consistently with COPD
      diagnosis alone. Our results support the need for further investigation into the 
      role of animal production-related exposures in the etiology of COPD and better
      respiratory protection for agricultural workers.

TI  - Environmental Styrene Exposure and Sensory and Motor Function in Gulf Coast
      Residents.
LID - 047006
AB  - Background:: Although styrene is an established neurotoxicant at occupational
      exposure levels, its neurotoxicity has not been characterized in relation to
      general population exposures. Further, occupational research to date has focused 
      on central nervous system impairment. Objective:: We assessed styrene-associated 
      differences in sensory and motor function among Gulf coast residents. Methods::
      We used 2011 National Air Toxics Assessment estimates of ambient styrene to
      determine exposure levels for 2,956 nondiabetic Gulf state residents enrolled in 
      the Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study, and additionally measured blood styrene
      concentration in a subset of participants 1 to 2 y after enrollment (n=310).
      Participants completed an enrollment telephone interview and a comprehensive test
      battery to assess sensory and motor function during a clinical follow-up exam 2
      to 4 y later. Detailed covariate information was ascertained at enrollment via
      telephone interview. We used multivariate linear regression to estimate
      continuous differences in sensory and motor function, and log-binomial regression
      to estimate prevalence ratios for dichotomous outcomes. We estimated associations
      of both ambient and blood styrene exposures with sensory and motor function,
      independently for five unique tests. Results:: Those participants in the highest 
      25% vs. lowest 75% of ambient exposure and those in the highest 10% vs. lowest
      90% of blood styrene had slightly diminished visual contrast sensitivity. Mean
      vibrotactile thresholds were lower among those in the highest vs. lowest quartile
      of ambient styrene and the highest 10% vs. lowest 90% of blood styrene (−0.13 log
      microns; 95% CI: −0.23, −0.03 and −0.39 log microns; 95% CI: −0.72, −0.05,
      respectively). The highest vs. lowest quartile of ambient styrene was associated 
      with significantly poorer postural stability, and (unexpectedly) with
      significantly greater grip strength. Discussion:: We observed associations
      between higher styrene exposure and poorer visual, sensory, and vestibular
      function, though we did not detect associations with reduced voluntary motor
      system performance. Associations were more consistent for ambient exposures, but 
      we also found notable associations with measured blood styrene.

TI  - Characteristics of Prehospital Electrocardiogram Use in North Carolina Using a
      Novel Linkage of Emergency Medical Services and Emergency Department Data.
PG  - 772-9
AB  - Objective:: Prehospital electrocardiography (ECG) is recommended for patients
      with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), yet only 20–80% of chest pain
      patients receive a prehospital ECG. Less is known about prehospital ECG use in
      patients with less common complaints (e.g., fatigue) suspicious for ACS who are
      transported by emergency medical services (EMS). The aims of this study were to
      determine: 1) the proportion of patients with chest pain and less typical
      complaints, and 2) patient characteristics associated with prehospital ECG use in
      patients transported by EMS to emergency departments across North Carolina.
      Methods:: A novel linked database was created between prehospital and emergency
      department (ED) patient care data from the North Carolina Prehospital Medical
      Information System and the North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and
      Epidemiologic Collection Tool. Institutional review board approval and a data use
      agreement were received prior to the start of the study. Patients ≥ 21
      transported during 2010–2014 by EMS with select variables were included. We
      examined patients’ complaints (symptoms), characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity,
      final hospital diagnosis), and prehospital ECG use (yes/no). Analysis included
      descriptive statistics and mixed logistic regression. Results:: During 2010–2014,
      there were 1,967,542 patients with linked EMS-ED data (mean age: 56.9 [SD: 22.2],
      43.2% male, 63.7% White). Of these, 643,174 (32.6%) received a prehospital ECG.
      Patients with prehospital ECG presented with the following complaints: 20% chest 
      pain; 10% shortness of breath; 6% abdominal pain/problems; 6% altered level of
      consciousness; 5% syncope/dizziness; 4% palpitations; 12% other complaints; and
      37% missing. Patients’ presenting complaints were the strongest predictor of
      prehospital ECG use, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, urbanicity, and
      date and time of EMS dispatch. Conclusions:: Patients with chest pain were
      significantly more likely to receive a prehospital ECG compared to those with
      less typical but suspicious complaints for ACS. Patients with less common
      presentations remain disadvantaged for early triage, risk stratification, and
      intervention prior to the hospital.

TI  - Wake Forest University long‐term follow‐up of type 2 myocardial infarction: The
      Wake‐Up T2MI Registry.
PG  - 592-604
AB  - Background: The Wake‐Up T2MI Registry is a retrospective cohort study
      investigating patients with type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI), acute myocardial
      injury, and chronic myocardial injury. We aim to explore risk stratification
      strategies and investigate clinical characteristics, management, and short‐ and
      long‐term outcomes in this high‐risk, understudied population. Methods: From 1
      January 2009 to 31 December 2010, 2846 patients were identified with T2MI or
      myocardial injury defined as elevated cardiac troponin I with at least one value 
      above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and coefficient of variation of
      10% (>40 ng/L) and meeting our inclusion criteria. Data of at least two serial
      troponin values will be collected from the electronic health records to
      differentiate between acute and chronic myocardial injury. The Fourth Universal
      Definition will be used to classify patients as having (a) T2MI, (b) acute
      myocardial injury, or (c) chronic myocardial injury during the index
      hospitalization. Long‐term mortality data will be collected through data linkage 
      with the National Death Index and North Carolina State Vital Statistics. Results:
      We have collected data for a total of 2205 patients as of November 2018. The mean
      age of the population was 65.6 ± 16.9 years, 48% were men, and 64% were white.
      Common comorbidities included hypertension (71%), hyperlipidemia (35%), and
      diabetes mellitus (30%). At presentation, 40% were on aspirin, 38% on β‐blockers,
      and 30% on statins. Conclusion: Improved characterization and profiling of this
      cohort may further efforts to identify evidence‐based strategies to improve
      cardiovascular outcomes among patients with T2MI and myocardial injury.

TI  - Transcriptome networks identify mechanisms of viral and non-viral asthma
      exacerbations in children.
PG  - 637-51
AB  - Respiratory infections are common precursors to asthma exacerbations in children,
      but molecular immune responses that determine whether and how an infection causes
      an exacerbation are poorly understood. Using systems-scale network analysis, we
      identify repertoires of cellular transcriptional pathways that lead to and
      underlie distinct patterns of asthma exacerbations. Specifically, in both
      virus-associated and non-viral exacerbations, we demonstrate a set of “core”
      exacerbation modules, consisting of early upregulation of epithelial associated
      SMAD3 signaling and down-regulation of lymphocyte response pathways, followed by 
      a later upregulation of effector pathways including epidermal growth factor
      receptor signaling, extracellular matrix, mucus hypersecretion, and eosinophil
      activation. We show an additional set of multiple inflammatory cell pathways
      involved in virus-associated exacerbations, in contrast to squamous cell pathways
      associated with non-viral exacerbations. Our work introduces an in vivo molecular
      platform to investigate, in a clinical setting, both the mechanisms of disease
      pathogenesis and, importantly, therapeutic targets to modify exacerbations.

TI  - Dose-Adjusted EPOCH-R Compared With R-CHOP as Frontline Therapy for Diffuse Large
      B-Cell Lymphoma: Clinical Outcomes of the Phase III Intergroup Trial
      Alliance/CALGB 50303.
PG  - 1790-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Alliance/CALGB 50303 (NCT00118209), an intergroup, phase III study,
      compared dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) with standard rituximab,
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) as frontline 
      therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients
      received six cycles of DA-EPOCH-R or R-CHOP. The primary objective was
      progression-free survival (PFS); secondary clinical objectives included response 
      rate, overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2013, 524
      patients were registered; 491 eligible patients were included in the final
      analysis. Most patients (74%) had stage III or IV disease; International
      Prognostic Index (IPI) risk groups included 26% IPI 0 to 1, 37% IPI 2, 25% IPI 3,
      and 12% IPI 4 to 5. At a median follow-up of 5 years, PFS was not statistically
      different between the arms (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.27; P = .65),
      with a 2-year PFS rate of 78.9% (95% CI, 73.8% to 84.2%) for DA-EPOCH-R and 75.5%
      (95% CI, 70.2% to 81.1%) for R-CHOP. OS was not different (hazard ratio, 1.09;
      95% CI, 0.75 to 1.59; P = .64), with a 2-year OS rate of 86.5% (95% CI, 82.3% to 
      91%) for DA-EPOCH-R and 85.7% (95% CI, 81.4% to 90.2%) for R-CHOP. Grade 3 and 4 
      adverse events were more common (P < .001) in the DA-EPOCH-R arm than the R-CHOP 
      arm, including infection (16.9% v 10.7%, respectively), febrile neutropenia
      (35.0% v 17.7%, respectively), mucositis (8.4% v 2.1%, respectively), and
      neuropathy (18.6% v 3.3%, respectively). Five treatment-related deaths (2.1%)
      occurred in each arm. CONCLUSION: In the 50303 study population, the more
      intensive, infusional DA-EPOCH-R was more toxic and did not improve PFS or OS
      compared with R-CHOP. The more favorable results with R-CHOP compared with
      historical controls suggest a potential patient selection bias and may preclude
      generalizability of results to specific risk subgroups.

TI  - Using Propensity Score Matching to Address Clinical Questions: The Impact of
      Remote Microphone Systems on Language Outcomes in Children Who Are Hard of
      Hearing.
PG  - 564-76
AB  - Purpose: Children who are hard of hearing (CHH) have restricted access to
      acoustic and linguistic information. Increased audibility provided by hearing
      aids influences language outcomes, but the benefits of hearing aids are often
      limited by acoustic factors and distance. Remote microphone (RM) systems further 
      increase auditory access by reducing the negative consequences of these factors. 
      The purpose of this article was to identify factors that influence likelihood of 
      RM system receipt and to investigate the effects of RM systems in home settings
      on later language outcomes. We used propensity score matching to compare language
      outcomes between children with and without access to personal RM systems in home 
      settings. This article provides a description of how and why to perform
      propensity score–matching analyses with clinical populations. Method:
      Participants were 132 CHH. Through parent report, we identified children who
      received RM systems for home use by 4 years of age. Logistic regression was used 
      to determine factors that predict likelihood of RM system receipt in home
      settings. Propensity score matching was conducted on a subgroup of 104
      participants. Performance on language measures at age 5 years was compared across
      propensity-matched children who did and did not receive RMs for personal use.
      Results: Likelihood of RM receipt was associated with degree of hearing loss,
      maternal education, and location (recruitment site). Comparisons between matched 
      pairs of children with and without RM systems in early childhood indicated
      significantly better discourse skills for children whose families owned RM
      systems, but no significant differences for vocabulary or morphosyntax.
      Conclusion: Results provide preliminary evidence that the provision of personal
      RM systems for preschool-age CHH enhances higher-level language skills. The
      propensity score–matching technique enabled us to use an observational,
      longitudinal data set to examine a question of clinical interest.

TI  - Dual Receipt of Prescription Opioids From the Department of Veterans Affairs and 
      Medicare Part D and Prescription Opioid Overdose Death Among Veterans: A Nested
      Case-Control Study.
PG  - 433-42
AB  - Background:: More than half of enrollees in the U.S. Department of Veterans
      Affairs (VA) are also covered by Medicare and can choose to receive their
      prescriptions from VA or from Medicare-participating providers. Such dual-system 
      care may lead to unsafe opioid use if providers in these 2 systems do not
      coordinate care or if prescription use is not tracked between systems.
      Objective:: To evaluate the association between dual-system opioid prescribing
      and death from prescription opioid overdose. Design:: Nested case-control study. 
      Setting:: VA and Medicare Part D. Participants:: Case and control patients were
      identified from all veterans enrolled in both VA and Part D who filled at least 1
      opioid prescription from either system. The 215 case patients who died of a
      prescription opioid overdose in 2012 or 2013 were matched (up to 1:4) with 833
      living control patients on the basis of date of death (that is, index date),
      using age, sex, race/ ethnicity, disability, enrollment in Medicaid or low-income
      subsidies, managed care enrollment, region and rurality of residence, and a
      medication-based measure of comorbid conditions. Measurements:: The exposure was 
      the source of opioid prescriptions within 6 months of the index date, categorized
      as VA only, Part D only, or VA and Part D (that is, dual use). The outcome was
      unintentional or undetermined-intent death from prescription opioid overdose,
      identified from the National Death Index. The association between this outcome
      and source of opioid prescriptions was estimated using conditional logistic
      regression with adjustment for age, marital status, prescription drug monitoring 
      programs, and use of other medications. RESULTS:: Among case patients, the mean
      age was 57.3 years (SD, 9.1), 194 (90%) were male, and 181 (84%) were non-
      Hispanic white. Overall, 60 case patients (28%) and 117 control patients (14%)
      received dual opioid prescriptions. Dual users had significantly higher odds of
      death from prescription opioid overdose than those who received opioids from VA
      only (odds ratio [OR], 3.53 [95% CI, 2.17 to 5.75]; P < 0.001) or Part D only
      (OR, 1.83 [CI, 1.20 to 2.77]; P = 0.005). Limitation:: Data are from 2012 to 2013
      and cannot capture prescriptions obtained outside the VA or Medicare Part D
      systems. Conclusion:: Among veterans enrolled in VA and Part D, dual use of
      opioid prescriptions was independently associated with death from prescription
      opioid overdose. This risk factor for fatal overdose among veterans underscores
      the importance of care coordination across health care systems to improve opioid 
      prescribing safety.

TI  - Cabozantinib in advanced non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma: a multicentre,
      retrospective, cohort study.
PG  - 581-90
AB  - Background: Cabozantinib is approved for patients with metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma on the basis of studies done in clear-cell histology. The activity of
      cabozantinib in patients with non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma is poorly
      characterised. We sought to analyse the antitumour activity and toxicity of
      cabozantinib in advanced non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Methods: We did a
      multicentre, international, retrospective cohort study of patients with
      metastatic non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma treated with oral cabozantinib
      during any treatment line at 22 centres: 21 in the USA and one in Belgium.
      Eligibility required patients with histologically confirmed non-clear-cell renal 
      cell carcinoma who received cabozantinib for metastatic disease during any
      treatment line roughly between 2015 and 2018. Mixed tumours with a clear-cell
      histology component were excluded. No other restrictive inclusion criteria were
      applied. Data were obtained from retrospective chart review by investigators at
      each institution. Demographic, surgical, pathological, and systemic therapy data 
      were captured with uniform database templates to ensure consistent data
      collection. The main objectives were to estimate the proportion of patients who
      achieved an objective response, time to treatment failure, and overall survival
      after treatment. Findings: Of 112 identified patients with non-clear-cell renal
      cell carcinoma treated at the participating centres, 66 (59%) had papillary
      histology, 17 (15%) had Xp11.2 translocation histology, 15 (13%) had unclassified
      histology, ten (9%) had chromophobe histology, and four (4%) had collecting duct 
      histology. The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response across
      all histologies was 30 (27%, 95% CI 19–36) of 112 patients. At a median follow-up
      of 11 months (IQR 6–18), median time to treatment failure was 6·7 months (95% CI 
      5·5–8·6), median progression-free survival was 7·0 months (5·7–9·0), and median
      overall survival was 12·0 months (9·2–17·0). The most common adverse events of
      any grade were fatigue (58 [52%]), and diarrhoea (38 [34%]). The most common
      grade 3 events were skin toxicity (rash and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia;
      five [4%]) and hypertension (four [4%]). No treatment-related deaths were
      observed. Across 54 patients with available next-generation sequencing data, the 
      most frequently altered somatic genes were CDKN2A (12 [22%]) and MET (11 [20%])
      with responses seen irrespective of mutational status. Interpretation: While we
      await results from prospective studies, this real-world study provides evidence
      supporting the antitumour activity and safety of cabozantinib across
      non-clear-cell renal cell carcinomas. Continued support of international
      collaborations and prospective ongoing studies targeting non-clear-cell renal
      cell carcinoma subtypes and specific molecular alterations are warranted to
      improve outcomes across these rare diseases with few evidence-based treatment
      options. Funding: None.

TI  - Effect of Epicutaneous Immunotherapy vs Placebo on Reaction to Peanut Protein
      Ingestion Among Children With Peanut Allergy: The PEPITES Randomized Clinical
      Trial.
PG  - 946-55
AB  - Question: What is the effect of epicutaneous immunotherapy on reactivity to
      peanut protein ingestion in peanut-allergic children? Finding: In this randomized
      clinical trial of 356 peanut-allergic children, the difference in treatment
      response rate (percentage of participants meeting a defined eliciting dose to
      peanut challenge) after 12 months of treatment with peanut-patch therapy,
      compared with placebo, was statistically significant (35.3% vs 13.6%), but did
      not meet a prespecified criterion (≥15% lower bound of the confidence interval)
      for a positive trial result. Meaning: Epicutaneous immunotherapy induced a
      statistically significant response compared with placebo in peanut-allergic
      children, but the study did not meet a component of the primary outcome.

TI  - Association Between Severe Serum Alanine Aminotransferase Flares and Hepatitis B 
      e Antigen Seroconversion and HBV DNA Decrease in Untreated Patients With Chronic 
      HBV Infection.
PG  - 2541-2551.e2
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS:: The incidence and outcomes of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
      flares during the natural history of chronic HBV infection has not been
      determined in a large, racially heterogeneous group of patients in North America.
      METHODS:: We collected data from the Hepatitis B Research Network—an
      observational cohort study of untreated adults with chronic HBV infection
      enrolled at 21 sites in the United States and Canada. Clinical and laboratory
      data were collected from 1587 participants (49.9% male, 73.7% Asian, 35.2%
      genotype B infection, mean age of 42.6 years) at enrollment, at weeks 12 and 24, 
      and every 24 weeks thereafter for a planned 5 years of follow up (from January
      2011 through May 2016). Participants were excluded if they had a history of
      hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, solid organ or bone marrow
      transplantation, chronic immune suppression, or antiviral therapy within 6 months
      before enrollment. Levels of ALT were measured in serum samples and flares were
      defined as at least 10 times the upper limit of normal (300 U/L in males and 200 
      U/L in females). RESULTS:: ALT flares occurred in 102 participants (6%), with 31 
      flares (30%) occurring at baseline. The 4-year cumulative incidence of ALT flares
      was 5.7%. The median peak level of ALT was 450 U/L (25th–75th percentile, 330 U/L
      to 747 U/L) with a maximum of 2578 U/L. In multivariable analysis, factors
      associated with the occurrence of an ALT flares were: male sex (odds ratio [OR], 
      3.02; P=.0007), higher baseline HBV DNA values (OR per log10, 1.41; P<.0001), at 
      risk alcohol use (OR, 2.27 vs none or moderate; P=.02), and higher FIB-4 values
      (OR, 1.85 per log2; P<.0001). Older age was associated with lower odds of an ALT 
      flare (OR, 0.63 per 10 years; P=.004). Rate of decrease in level of HBV DNA by 1 
      log10 or more (59 vs 23 per 100 person-years for HB e antigen (HBeAg)-positive vs
      HBeAg-negative patients; P=.003) and HBeAg loss (47 vs 15 per 100 person-years;
      P=.002) were higher in patients with an ALT flare than in patients without, but
      the rate of HBsAg loss was similar (4 vs 2 per 100 person-years; P=.26). No
      hepatic decompensation, liver transplants, or deaths were observed in
      participants with ALT flares. CONCLUSION:: In a large racially heterogeneous
      cohort of adults with chronic HBV infection, the cumulative incidence of severe
      ALT flares was low and associated with greater decreases in HBV DNA and loss of
      HBeAg, but not with loss of HBsAg.

TI  - Financial burden amongst cancer patients treated with curative intent surgery
      alone.
PG  - 452-6
AB  - Background:: The costs of cancer care in the US continue to increase and may have
      serious consequences for patients. We hypothesize that even cancer patients
      treated with curative-intent surgery alone experience substantial financial
      burden. Methods:: A questionnaire was administered to adult cancer patients who
      were treated with curative-intent surgery. Survey items included a validated
      instrument for measuring financial toxicity, the COST score. Demographic
      variables and survey responses were examined using Chi-square and Fisher exact
      tests. A multivariate general linear model was performed to examine the
      relationship between age and COST score. Results:: COST scores varied widely. 30%
      of respondents had a COST score of ≤24 (high burden). Younger participants
      reported more financial burden (p = 0.008). Respondents reported that financial
      factors influenced their decisions regarding surgery (14%) and caused them to
      skip recommended care (4.7%). Cancer care influenced overall financial health
      (38%) and contributed to medical debt (26%). Conclusion:: Curative-intent cancer 
      care places a substantial portion of patients at risk for financial toxicity even
      when they don’t require chemotherapy. Interventions should not be limited to
      patients receiving chemotherapy.

TI  - The Development and Testing of a Relationship Skills Intervention to Improve HIV 
      Prevention Uptake Among Young Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men 
      and Their Primary Partners (We Prevent): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled
      Trial.
LID - e10370
AB  - Background: Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM)
      continue to be the group most heavily impacted by HIV in the United States.
      Substantial evidence indicates that up to two-thirds of new HIV infections occur 
      in the context of a main partnership. Couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC)
      has been shown to be a promising and effective strategy for increasing HIV
      prevention uptake among male couples; however, YMSM who are new to relationships 
      may not have yet developed the efficacy, negotiation, and communication skills to
      navigate HIV testing in their relationship and communicate around developing a
      prevention plan. Objective: This study aims to develop and test a relationship
      skills–focused HIV prevention intervention for YMSM and their partners. The
      intervention consists of two telehealth-delivered sessions: the first focuses on 
      relationship skills and the second consists of CHTC and prevention planning. Both
      sessions are attended by both members of the dyad. Methods: This protocol
      describes the development of the proposed intervention (We Prevent) and pilot
      test to examine its feasibility and preliminary efficacy. The intervention will
      include two motivational interviewing–based sessions: session one is a
      relationship skills–building session, focused on techniques to explore and build 
      communication skills in a relationship, to help YMSM develop and enhance
      necessary skills for their current and future relationships; the second session
      is a CHTC session with YMSM and their partners, to help them develop an HIV
      prevention plan. Through qualitative data collection and a one-arm pilot with
      YMSM, we will develop and refine a developmentally appropriate relationship
      skills session as an addition to the current CHTC intervention. We will then
      conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing the acceptability,
      feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted two-session telehealth
      intervention for YMSM versus a control group receiving one session only—a CHTC
      session delivered via telehealth. Results: The We Prevent intervention is
      designed to increase uptake of HIV prevention, shown through self-reported
      reductions in condomless sex and increases in knowledge and uptake of
      pre-exposure prophylaxis. In addition, the intervention is designed to increase
      HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing. STI incidence is examined
      as a secondary outcome. A cost-input analysis will examine the costs associated
      with intervention delivery to inform future scale-up of the intervention.
      Conclusions: Drawing on theory and existing CHTC protocols delivered with
      video-based counseling, this proposed intervention affords the opportunity to
      empower YMSM with the skills necessary to communicate with their partners and
      protect themselves from HIV in their current and future relationships. Trial

TI  - Opinions and Practices of Lung Cancer Screening by Physician Specialty.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to the National Lung Screening Trial, numerous
      professional organizations published guidelines recommending annual lung cancer
      screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for high-risk patients. Prior 
      studies found that physician attitudes and knowledge about lung cancer screening 
      directly impacts the number of screening exams ordered. METHODS: In 2015, we
      surveyed 34 pulmonologists and 186 primary care providers (PCPs) to evaluate
      opinions and practices of lung cancer screening in a large academic medical
      center. We compared PCP and pulmonologist responses using t-tests and ᵪ2 tests.
      RESULTS: The overall survey response rate was 40% (39% for PCPs and 50% for
      pulmonologists). Pulmonologists were more likely than PCPs to report lung cancer 
      screening as beneficial for patients (88.2% versus 37.7%, P < .0001) and as being
      cost-effective (47.1% versus 14.3%, P = .02). More pulmonologists (76%) reported 
      ordering a LDCT for screening in the past 12 months compared to PCPs (41%, P =
      .012). Pulmonologists and PCPs reported similar barriers to referring patients
      for lung cancer screening, including patient costs (82.4% versus 77.8%),
      potential for emotional harm (58.8% versus 58.3%), high false positive rate
      (47.1% versus 69.4%), and likelihood for medical complications (47.1% versus
      59.7%). LIMITATIONS: Our results are generalizable to academic medical centers
      and responses may be susceptible to recall bias, non-response bias, and social
      desirability bias. CONCLUSION: We found significant differences in opinions and
      practices between PCPs and pulmonologists regarding lung cancer screening
      referrals and perceived benefits. As lung cancer screening continues to emerge in
      clinical practice, it is important to understand these differences across
      provider specialty to ensure screening is implemented and offered to patients
      appropriately.

      Epidemiology of Injuries in US High School Girls' Lacrosse (2008–2009 Through
      2013–2014) and National Collegiate Athletic Association Women's Lacrosse
      (2004–2005 Through 2013–2014).
PG  - 42-54
AB  - Context: The advent of Web-based sports injury surveillance via programs such as 
      the High School Reporting Information Online (HS RIO) system and the National
      Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP) has aided 
      the acquisition of girls' and women's lacrosse injury data. Objective: To
      describe the epidemiology of injuries sustained in high school girls' lacrosse in
      the 2008–2009 through 2013–2014 academic years and collegiate women's lacrosse in
      the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014-academic years using Web-based sports injury
      surveillance. Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Online injury
      surveillance from high school girls' (annual average = 55) and collegiate women's
      (annual average = 19) lacrosse teams. Patients or Other Participants: Female
      lacrosse players who participated in practices or competitions during the
      2008–2009 through 2013–2014 academic years for high school or the 2004–2005
      through 2013–2014 academic years for college. Main Outcome Measure(s): Athletic
      trainers collected time-loss injury (≥24 hours) and exposure data. We calculated 
      injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), injury rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs), and injury proportions by body site and diagnosis.
      Results: High school RIO documented 700 time-loss injuries during 481 687 AEs;
      the NCAA-ISP documented 1027 time-loss injuries during 287 856 AEs. The total
      injury rate during 2008–2009 through 2013–2014 was higher in college than in high
      school (2.55 versus 1.45/1000 AEs; IRR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.54, 1.99). Most
      injuries occurred during competitions in high school (51.1%) and practices in
      college (63.8%). Rates were higher during competitions compared with practices in
      high school (IRR = 2.32; 95% CI = 2.00, 2.69) and college (IRR = 2.38; 95% CI =
      2.09, 2.70). Concussion was the most common diagnosis among all high school and
      most collegiate player positions, and the main mechanism of contact was with a
      playing apparatus (eg, stick, ball). Ligament sprains were also common (HS RIO
      practices = 22.2%, competitions = 30.3%; NCAA-ISP practices = 25.5%, competitions
      = 30.9%). Conclusions: Rates of injury were higher in college versus high school 
      female lacrosse players and in competitions versus practices. Injury-prevention
      strategies are essential to decrease the incidence and severity of concussions
      and ligament sprains.

      Results: High School Reporting Information Online documented 1407 time-loss
      injuries during 662 960 AEs. The National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury 
      Surveillance Program documented 1882 time-loss injuries during 390 029 AEs. The
      total injury rate from 2008–2009 through 2013–2014 was higher in college than in 
      high school (3.77 versus 2.12/1000 AEs; IRR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.63, 1.94). Most
      injuries occurred during competitions in high school (61.4%) and practices in
      college (61.4%). Injury rates were higher in competitions compared with practices
      in high school (IRR = 3.59; 95% CI = 3.23, 4.00) and college (IRR = 3.38; 95% CI 
      = 3.08, 3.71). Lower limb injuries, muscle strains, and ligament sprains were
      common at both levels. Concussion was the most frequent competition diagnosis for
      all high school player positions. Conclusions: Rates of time-loss injury were
      higher in college versus high school and in competitions versus practices.
      Attention to preventing common lower leg injuries and concussions, especially at 
      the high school level, is essential to decrease their incidence and severity.

TI  - Epidemiology of Exertional Heat Illnesses in National Collegiate Athletic
      Association Athletes During the 2009–2010 Through 2014–2015 Academic Years.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - Context: Exertional heat illnesses (EHIs) among football athletes have been
      widely researched, but data examining all collegiate sports are limited.
      Objective: To describe the epidemiology of EHI in 25 National Collegiate Athletic
      Association (NCAA) sports. Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: The
      NCAA Injury Surveillance Program during the 2009–2010 through 2014–2015 academic 
      years. Patients or Other Participants: A voluntary sample of 166 NCAA
      institutions over 2048 team-seasons. Main Outcome Measure(s): Athletic trainers
      reported EHIs to the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program. Only EHIs sustained during
      a sanctioned practice or competition were included. The EHI rate, specific
      diagnoses, and number of emergency transports were measured. Results: Overall,
      232 EHI events were reported (0.47/10 000 athlete-exposures [AEs]; 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 0.41, 0.53). Football comprised 75% of all EHI events and had the
      largest rate (1.55/10 000 AEs; 95% CI = 1.32, 1.78). The overall EHI rate was
      higher in preseason practices (1.16/10 000 AEs) than all other time periods
      (regular and postseason practices and all competitions; 0.23/10 000 AEs, injury
      rate ratio [IRR] = 4.96; 95% CI = 3.79, 6.50). This result was retained when
      examining the individual sports of football (3.65/10 000 versus 0.63/10 000 AEs, 
      IRR = 5.82; 95% CI = 4.18, 8.10), men's soccer (1.11/10 000 versus 0.07/10 000
      AEs, IRR = 16.819; 95% CI = 1.89, 138.55), and women's soccer (1.10/10 000 versus
      0.05/10 000 AEs, IRR = 22.52; 95% CI = 2.77, 183.05). The EHI rates were highest 
      in states with elevated annual temperatures (1.05/10 000 AEs). Heat cramps (39%),
      heat exhaustion (27%), and dehydration (29%) were the most common types of EHI.
      Nineteen athletes with EHI (8%) required emergency transport. Conclusions:
      Football players continue to experience the most EHIs; however, EHIs can
      potentially occur in all NCAA sports. Continued emphasis on preseason EHI
      policies and institution-specific environmental guidelines is needed to address
      EHI rates.

TI  - Pay-it-forward dual gonorrhea/chlamydia test uptake among men who have sex with
      men in China: A pragmatic, quasi-experimental study.
PG  - 76-82
AB  - Background:: Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) rarely receive
      gonorrhea/chlamydia testing. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate a
      pay-it-forward strategy to increase gonorrhea/chlamydia testing among MSM.
      Pay-it-forward has one person receive a gift, then asks the same person if they
      would like to give a gift to another person. Methods:: We used a
      quasi-experimental pragmatic study to compare a pay-it-forward model to standard 
      of care at two HIV testing sites for MSM. A pay-it-forward program was
      implemented for three months, during which men were offered free
      gonorrhea/chlamydia testing and given the option of donating money toward testing
      for future participants. Both sites then switched to standard of care for three
      months, offering dual testing at the standard price. We compared test uptake and 
      financial costs in the two groups. Findings:: 408 men were included in this
      study. 203 men were offered pay-it-forward, and 205 were offered standard of
      care. Overall, 109 (109/203, 53·7%) men received gonorrhea/chlamydia testing in
      the pay-it-forward group and 12 (12/205, 5·9%) men received gonorrhea/chlamydia
      testing in the standard of care group (adjusted odds ratio 19·73, 95%CI
      10·02–38·85). This was a first gonorrhea or chlamydia test for 86% (104/121) of
      men. 89% (97/109) of men in the pay-it-forward group donated some amount. The
      incremental unit cost per test in the pay-it-forward group was 67 USD, compared
      to 503 USD in the standard of care group. Interpretation:: Pay-it-forward may be 
      a sustainable model for expanding integrated HIV testing services among MSM in
      China.

TI  - Brief Report: Maternal Opioid Prescription from Preconception Through Pregnancy
      and the Odds of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Autism Features in Children.
PG  - 376-82
AB  - Opioid use during pregnancy is associated with suboptimal pregnancy outcomes.
      Little is known about child neurodevelopmental outcomes. We examined associations
      between maternal opioid prescriptions preconception to delivery (peri-pregnancy) 
      and child’s risk of ASD, developmental delay/disorder (DD) with no ASD features, 
      or ASD/DD with autism features in the Study to Explore Early Development, a
      case-control study of neurodevelopment. Preconception opioid prescription was
      associated with 2.43 times the odds of ASD [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99,
      6.02] and 2.64 times the odds of ASD/ DD with autism features (95% CI 1.10, 6.31)
      compared to mothers without prescriptions. Odds for ASD and ASD/DD were
      non-significantly elevated for first trimester prescriptions. Work exploring
      mechanisms and timing between peri-pregnancy opioid use and child
      neurodevelopment is needed.

TI  - Cognitive Rehabilitation with Mobile Technology and Social Support for Veterans
      with TBI and PTSD: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Objective:: To investigate effects of cognitive rehabilitation with mobile
      technology and social support on veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants:: There were 112 dyads,
      comprised by a veteran and a family member or friend (224 participants total).
      Design:: Dyads were randomized to: 1) a novel intervention, Cognitive
      Applications for Life Management (CALM), involving goal management training plus 
      mobile devices for cueing and training attentional control, or 2) Brain Health
      Training, involving psychoeducation plus mobile devices to train visual memory.
      Main Measures:: Executive dysfunction (disinhibition, impulsivity) and emotional 
      dysregulation (anger, maladaptive interpersonal behaviors) collected prior to
      randomization and following intervention completion at six months. Results:: The 
      clinical trial yielded negative findings regarding executive dysfunction but
      positive findings on measures of emotion dysregulation. Veterans randomized to
      CALM reported a 25% decrease in anger over six months compared to 8% reduction in
      the control (B=−5.27, p=.008). Family/friends reported veterans randomized to
      CALM engaged in 26% fewer maladaptive interpersonal behaviors (e.g., aggression) 
      over six months compared to 6% reduction in the control (B =−2.08, p=.016). An
      unanticipated result was clinically meaningful change in reduced PTSD symptoms
      among veterans randomized to CALM (p<.001). Conclusion:: This preliminary study
      demonstrated effectiveness of CALM for reducing emotional dysregulation in
      veterans with TBI and PTSD.

TI  - Daytime Compared With Nighttime Differences in Management and Outcomes of
      Postpartum Hemorrhage.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - Objective:: To assess whether postpartum hemorrhage management or subsequent
      morbidity differs based on whether delivery occurred during the day or night.
      Methods:: We conducted a secondary analysis of a multicenter observational
      obstetric cohort of more than 115,000 mother-baby pairs from 25 hospitals
      (2008–2011). This analysis included women delivering singleton or twin births who
      experienced postpartum hemorrhage (estimated blood loss [EBL] >500cc for vaginal 
      delivery, EBL >1000cc for cesarean delivery, or documented treatment for
      postpartum hemorrhage). Nighttime delivery was defined as that occurring between 
      8pm and 6am. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal morbidity (death,
      hysterectomy, intensive care unit admission, transfusion, or unanticipated
      procedure for bleeding). Secondary outcomes included EBL, uterotonic use, and
      procedures to treat bleeding that occurred during the postpartum hospitalization.
      Multivariable logistic, linear, quantile, and multinomial regression models were 
      used to assess associations between nighttime delivery and outcomes, adjusting
      for potential patient-level confounders and hospital as a fixed effect. Results::
      In total, 2,709 (34.2%) of 7,917 women with postpartum hemorrhage delivered at
      night. Women who delivered at night were younger, had a lower body mass index,
      and were more likely to have government-sponsored insurance, be nulliparous, have
      hypertension, use neuraxial analgesia, and deliver vaginally. After adjusting for
      potential confounders, the primary composite outcome of maternal morbidity was
      similar regardless of night vs. day delivery (15.5% night vs. 17.5% day; aOR
      0.89, 95% CI 0.77–1.03). Some secondary outcomes, including mean EBL, frequency
      of uterotonic use, and time from delivery to first uterotonic dose differed on
      unadjusted analyses but, these associations did not persist in multivariable
      analysis. The study had limited power to assess differences in uncommon outcomes.
      Conclusion:: Nighttime delivery was not associated with significant differences
      in postpartum hemorrhage-related management or morbidity.

TI  - Diagnostic assessment of assumptions for external validity: An example using data
      in metastatic colorectal cancer.
PG  - 103-11
AB  - Background:: Methods developed to estimate intervention effects in external
      target populations assume that all important effect measure modifiers have been
      identified and appropriately modeled. Propensity score-based diagnostics can be
      used to assess the plausibility of these assumptions for weighting methods.
      Methods:: We demonstrate the use of these diagnostics when assessing the
      transportability of treatment effects from the standard of care for metastatic
      colorectal cancer control arm in a phase III trial (HORIZON III) to a target
      population of 1,942 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ years. Results:: In an
      unadjusted comparison, control arm participants had lower mortality compared with
      target population patients treated with the standard of care therapy [trial vs.
      target hazard ratio (HR)= 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58, 0.89].
      Applying inverse odds of sampling weights attenuated the trial vs. target HR
      (weighted HR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.26). However, whether unadjusted or weighted, 
      hazards did not appear proportional. At 6 months of follow-up, mortality was
      lower in the weighted trial population than the target population (weighted trial
      vs. target risk difference (RD) = −0.07, 95% CI −0.13, −0.01), but not at 12
      months (weighted RD= 0.00, 95% CI: −0.09, 0.09). Conclusion:: These diagnostics
      suggest direct transport of treatment effects from HORIZON III to the Medicare
      population is not valid. However, the proposed sampling model might allow valid
      transport of the treatment effects on longer-term mortality from HORIZON III to
      the Medicare population treated in clinical practice.

TI  - Metallic Air Pollutants and Breast Cancer Risk in a Nationwide Cohort Study.
PG  - 20-8
AB  - Background: Toxic metals show evidence of carcinogenic and estrogenic properties.
      However, little is known about the relationship between airborne metals and
      breast cancer. We evaluated the risk of breast cancer in relation to exposure to 
      toxic metallic substances in air, individually and combined, in a U.S. wide
      cohort. Methods: We recruited Sister Study participants (n=50,884), breast
      cancer-free women who had a sister with breast cancer, from 2003–2009. The 2005
      Environmental Protection Agency National Air Toxic Assessment’s census-tract
      estimates of metal concentrations in air (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium,
      cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium) were matched to
      participants’ enrollment residence. We used Cox regression to estimate the
      association between quintiles of individual metals and breast cancer incidence
      and weighted quantile sum regression to model the association between the metal
      mixture and breast cancer. Results: 2,587 breast cancer cases were diagnosed
      during follow-up (mean=7.4 years). In individual chemical analyses comparing the 
      highest to lowest quintiles, postmenopausal breast cancer risk was elevated for
      mercury (hazard ratio [HR]=1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1–1.5), cadmium
      (HR=1.1, 95%CI: 0.96–1.3), and lead (HR=1.1, 95%CI: 0.98–1.3). The weighted
      quantile sum index was associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (odds ratio
      (OR)=1.1, 95%CI: 1.0–1.1). Consistent with the individual chemical analysis, the 
      most highly weighted chemicals for predicting postmenopausal breast cancer risk
      were lead, cadmium, and mercury. Results were attenuated for overall breast
      cancer. Conclusions: Higher levels of some airborne metals, specifically mercury,
      cadmium, and lead, were associated with a higher risk of postmenopausal breast
      cancer.

TI  - Natural history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-2 in HIV-positive women of 
      reproductive age.
PG  - 573-9
AB  - Objective:: To evaluate the natural history of treated and untreated cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia-2 (CIN2) among HIV-positive women. Methods::
      Participants were women enrolled in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study between
      1994 and 2013. 104 HIV-positive women diagnosed with CIN2 before age 46 were
      selected, contributing 2,076 visits over a median of 10 years (IQR 5–16). The
      outcome of interest was biopsy-confirmed CIN2 progression, defined as CIN3 or
      invasive cervical cancer. CIN2 treatment was abstracted from medical records.
      Results:: The majority of women were African American (53%), current smokers
      (53%) and had a median age of 33 years at CIN2 diagnosis. Among the 104
      HIV-positive women, 62 (59.6%) did not receive CIN2 treatment. Twelve
      HIV-positive women (11.5%) showed CIN2 progression to CIN3; none were diagnosed
      with cervical cancer. There was no difference in the median time to progression
      between CIN2-treated and -untreated HIV-positive women (2.9 vs. 2.7 years,
      p=0.41). CIN2 treatment was not associated with CIN2 progression in multivariate 
      analysis (aHR [adjusted hazard ratio] 1.82; 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.54,
      7.11), adjusting for combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and CD4+ T cell
      count. In HIV-positive women, each increase of 100 CD4+ T cells was associated
      with a 33% decrease in CIN2 progression (aHR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47, 0.88), adjusting 
      for CIN2 treatment and cART. Conclusions:: CIN2 progression is uncommon in this
      population, regardless of CIN2 treatment. Additional studies are needed to
      identify factors to differentiate women at highest risk of CIN2 progression.

TI  - Determinants of environmental styrene exposure in Gulf coast residents.
PG  - 831-41
AB  - Background:: In a previous study of exposure to oil-related chemicals in Gulf
      coast residents, we measured blood levels of volatile organic compounds. Levels
      of styrene were substantially elevated compared to a nationally representative
      sample. We sought to identify factors contributing to these levels, given the
      opportunities for styrene exposure in this community. Methods:: We measured blood
      styrene levels in 667 Gulf coast residents and compared participants’ levels of
      blood styrene to a nationally representative sample. We assessed personal and
      environmental predictors of blood styrene levels using linear regression and
      predicted the risk of elevated blood styrene (defined as above the National
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 95th percentile) using modified Poisson
      regression. We assessed exposure to styrene using questionnaire data on recent
      exposure opportunities and leveraged existing databases to assign ambient styrene
      exposure based on geocoded residential location. Results:: These Gulf coast
      residents were 4–6 times as likely as the nationally representative sample to
      have elevated blood styrene levels. The change in styrene (log ng/mL) was 0.42
      (95% CI: 0.34, 0.51) for smoking, 0.34 (0.09, 0.59) for time spent in vehicles
      and 1.10 (0.31, 1.89) for boats, and −0.41 (−0.73, −0.10) for fall/winter blood
      draws. Residential proximity to industrial styrene emissions did not predict
      blood styrene levels. Ambient styrene predicted elevated blood styrene in
      subgroups. Conclusions:: Personal predictors of increasing blood styrene levels
      included smoking, vehicle emissions, and housing characteristics. There was a
      suggestive association between ambient and blood styrene. Our measures of
      increased regional exposure opportunity do not fully explain the observed
      elevated blood styrene levels in this population.

TI  - US acculturation and poor sleep among an intergenerational cohort of adult
      Latinos in Sacramento, California.
LID - zsy246
AB  - Acculturation may shape the disproportionate burden of poor sleep among Latinos
      in the United States. Existing studies are limited by unidimensional
      acculturation proxies that are incapable of capturing cultural complexities
      across generations. Understanding how acculturation relates to sleep may lead to 
      the identification of modifiable intervention targets. We used multivariable
      regression and latent class methods to examine cross-sectional associations
      between a validated multidimensional scale of US acculturation and self-reported 
      poor sleep measures. We analyzed an intergenerational cohort: first-generation
      (GEN1) older Latinos (Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging; N = 1,716; median
      age: 69.5) and second-generation (GEN2) middle-aged offspring and relatives of
      GEN1 (Niños Lifestyle and Diabetes Study; N = 670; median age: 54.0) in
      Sacramento, California. GEN1 with high US acculturation, compared with high
      acculturation towards another origin/ancestral country, had less restless sleep
      (prevalence ratio [PR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.67 [0.54, 0.84]) and a
      higher likelihood of being in the best sleep class than the worst (OR [95% CI]:
      1.62 [1.09, 2.40]), but among nonmanual occupations, high intergenerational US
      acculturation was associated with more general fatigue (PR [95% CI: 1.86 [1.11,
      3.10]). GEN2 with high intergenerational US acculturation reported shorter sleep 
      (PR [95% CI]: 2.86 [1.02, 7.99]). High US acculturation shaped sleep
      differentially by generation, socioeconomic context, and intergenerational
      acculturative status. High US acculturation was associated with better sleep
      among older, lower socioeconomic Latinos, but with shorter sleep duration among
      middle-aged, higher socioeconomic Latinos; results also differed by parental
      acculturation status. Upon replication, future studies should incorporate
      prospective and intergenerational designs to uncover sociobehavioral pathways by 
      which acculturation may shape sleep to ultimately inform intervention efforts.

TI  - Breast Cancer Risk After Recent Childbirth:A Pooled Analysis of 15 Prospective
      Studies.
PG  - 22-30
AB  - Background:: Parity is widely recognized as protective for breast cancer, but
      breast cancer risk may be increased shortly after childbirth. Whether this risk
      varies with breastfeeding, family history of breast cancer, or specific tumor
      subtype has rarely been evaluated. Objective:: To characterize breast cancer risk
      in relation to recent childbirth. Design:: Pooled analysis of individual-level
      data from 15 prospective cohort studies. Setting:: The international
      Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group. Participants:: Women younger
      than 55 years. Measurements:: During 9.6 million person-years of follow-up, 18
      826 incident cases of breast cancer were diagnosed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
      CIs for breast cancer were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. 
      Results:: Compared with nulliparous women, parous women had an HR for breast
      cancer that peaked about 5 years after birth (HR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.63 to 1.99])
      before decreasing to 0.77 (CI, 0.67 to 0.88) after 34 years. The association
      crossed over from positive to negative about 24 years after birth. The overall
      pattern was driven by estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer; no crossover
      was seen for ER-negative cancer. Breast cancer risk increases after childbirth
      were pronounced when combined with a family history of breast cancer, and greater
      for women who were older at first birth or who had more births. Breastfeeding did
      not modify risk patterns. Limitations:: Breast cancer diagnoses during pregnancy 
      were not uniformly distinguishable from early postpartum diagnoses. Data on human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene overexpression were limited.
      Conclusion:: Compared with nulliparous women, parous women have an increased risk
      for breast cancer for more than 20 years after childbirth. Health care providers 
      should consider recent childbirth a risk factor for breast cancer in young women.

TI  - Persistent disparities over time in the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverage 
      intake among children in the United States.
PG  - 79-89
AB  - Background: Recent research suggests that sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB)
      consumption has been declining among US children aged 2–18 y. However, most
      studies focused on changes in mean intake, ignore high SSB consumers and do not
      examine intake among vulnerable groups and, including adolescents, low-income
      households, and several racial/ethnic minorities. Objective: The aim was to
      estimate usual SSB intake from NHANES surveys from 2003–2004 to 2013–2014 to
      examine shifts at both the median and 90th percentile among US children,
      evaluating the extent to which intake disparities in total SSBs and subtypes have
      persisted. Design: Children 2–18 y from NHANES 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011 and
      2013. SSBs were all non-diet beverages sweetened with sugars including revising
      all beverages to as consumed status and excluding soy and dairy based beverages. 
      The NCI usual intake method was used to estimate usual intake from two 24-hour
      recalls. A 2-part correlated model accounted for nonconsumers. Quantile
      regression was then used to examine differences in SSB usual intakes at the 50th 
      and 90th percentiles by race-ethnicity, and examine interactions indicating
      whether racial-ethnic disparities in intake were modified by income. Results:
      Despite considerable declines, children's SSB intake remains high, particularly
      among heavy consumers. Among adolescents, median SSB intake in 2013–2014 was on
      the order of 150–200 kcal/d, and heavy intake at the 90th percentile was on the
      order of 250–300 kcal/d. There were important disparities in intake that
      persisted over time. Although high household income was associated with lower SSB
      intake in non-Hispanic white (NHW) children, intakes of non-Hispanic black (NHB) 
      and Mexican-American (MA) children from these households were similar to or
      higher than those from poor households. There were also large racial/ethnic
      differences in the types of SSBs consumed. The consumption of regular sodas by
      NHB children was somewhat lower than among MA and NHW children, whereas fruit
      drink intake was markedly higher. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest
      that, despite recent declines, strategies are needed to further reduce SSB
      consumption, and particularly heavy intake, especially among NHB children where
      fruit drinks also are key source of SSBs.

TI  - Natural control of HIV infection in young women in South Africa: HPTN 068.
PG  - 202-8
AB  - Background:: Some individuals control HIV replication without antiretroviral
      (ARV) therapy. Objective:: To analyze viral suppression in young women in rural
      South Africa enrolled in a trial evaluating a behavioral intervention for HIV
      prevention. Methods:: Plasma samples were obtained from women ages 13–24 (81
      infected at enrollment, 164 seroconverters). ARV testing was performed using an
      assay that detects 20 ARV drugs. Women were classified as viremic controllers if 
      they were virally suppressed for ≥12 months with no ARV drug use. Results::
      Samples from 216/245 (88.2%) women had no ARV drugs detected at their first
      HIV-positive visit. Thirty-four (15.7%) of the 216 women had a viral load <2,000 
      copies/mL. Fifteen of the 34 women were followed for ≥12 months; 12 were virally 
      suppressed with no ARV drugs detected during follow-up. These women were
      classified as viremic controllers (overall: 12/216=5.6%). The median CD4 cell
      count at the first HIV-positive visit was higher among the 12 controllers than
      among the 204 women who were not using ARV drugs (759 vs. 549 cells/mm3, p=0.02).
      Some women had a viral load <40 copies/mL at a single study visit, but none were 
      classified as elite controllers (viral load <40 copies/mL for ≥12 months with no 
      ARV drug use). Conclusions:: In this cohort, 5.6% of women who were not using ARV
      drugs had sustained viral suppression. This represents a minimum estimate of the 
      frequency of viremic controllers in this cohort, since some women were not
      followed long enough to meet the criteria for classification.

TI  - Trends in drug use-associated infective endocarditis and heart valve surgery,
      2007 to 2017.
PG  - 31-40
AB  - Background:: Drug use-associated infective endocarditis (DUA-IE) is rising during
      the opioid epidemic. Infective endocarditis (IE) can require valve surgery, but
      surgical treatment of DUA-IE has invoked controversy and the extent of its use is
      unknown. Objective:: To examine hospitalization trends for DUA-IE, the proportion
      with surgery, patient characteristics, length of stay and charges. Design::
      Ten-year analysis of a statewide hospital discharge database. Setting:: North
      Carolina hospitals, 2007–2017. Patients:: All patients hospitalized for IE aged ≥
      18 years. Measurements:: Annual trends in all IE hospitalizations and those with 
      valve surgery, stratified by patients’ drug use. Characteristics of DUA-IE
      surgical hospitalizations including demographics, length of stay, disposition and
      charges. Results:: Of 22,825 IE hospitalizations, 2,602 (11%) were for DUA-IE.
      Valve surgery was performed in 1,655 (7%) IE hospitalizations, including 285
      (17%) for DUA-IE. Annual DUA-IE hospitalizations increased from 0.92 to 10.95 per
      100,000, and DUA-IE hospitalizations with surgery rose from 0.10 per 100,000 to
      1.38 per 100,000. In the final year, surgeries for DUA-IE comprised 42% of IE
      valve surgeries. Compared to other IE surgical patients, DUA-IE patients were
      younger (median age 33 vs. 56), more commonly female (47% vs. 33%) and White (89%
      vs. 63%), and primarily insured by Medicaid (38%) or uninsured (35%). Hospital
      stays for DUA-IE were longer (median 27 vs. 17 days) with higher median charges
      ($250,994 vs. $198,764). Charges for 282 DUA-IE hospitalizations exceeded
      $78,000,000. Limitations:: Reliance on administrative data and billing codes.
      Conclusions:: DUA-IE hospitalizations and valve surgeries increased over
      twelve-fold and DUA-IE approached half of all IE valve surgeries. The swell of
      DUA-IE patients is reshaping the scope, type, and financing of healthcare
      resources needed for effective IE treatment.

TI  - Maternal health outcomes among HIV-infected breastfeeding women with high CD4
      counts: results of a treatment strategy trial.
PG  - 209-24
AB  - Background:: IMPAACT PROMISE 1077BF/FF was a randomized study of antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) strategies for pregnant and postpartum women with high CD4 T-cell
      counts. We describe postpartum outcomes for women in the study who were
      randomized to continue or discontinue ART after delivery. Methods:: Women with
      pre-ART CD4 cell counts ≥350 cells/mm3 who started ART during pregnancy were
      randomized postpartum to continue or discontinue treatment. Women were enrolled
      from India, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The
      primary outcome was a composite of progression to AIDS-defining illness or death.
      Log-rank tests and Cox regression models assessed treatment effects. Incidence
      rates were calculated per 100 person-years. A post-hoc analysis evaluated WHO
      Stage 2/3 events. All analyses were intent-to-treat. Findings:: 1611 women were
      enrolled (June 2011-October 2014) and 95% were breastfeeding. Median age at entry
      was 27 years, CD4 count 728 cells/mm3 and the majority of women were Black
      African (97%). After a median follow-up of 1.6 years, progression to
      AIDS-defining illness or death was rare and there was no significant difference
      between arms (HR: 0·55; 95%CI 0·14, 2·08, p=0·37). WHO Stage 2/3 events were
      reduced with continued ART (HR: 0·60; 95%CI 0·39, 0·90, p=0·01). The arms did not
      differ with respect to the rate of grade 2, 3 or 4 safety events (p=0·61).
      Interpretation:: Serious clinical events were rare among predominately
      breastfeeding women with high CD4 cell counts over 18 months after delivery. ART 
      had significant benefit in reducing WHO 2/3 events in this population.

      Epidemiology of Injuries in US High School Boys' Wrestling (2005–2006 Through
      2013–2014) and National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Wrestling
      (2004–2005 Through 2013–2014).
PG  - 1143-55
AB  - Context: The advent of Web-based sports injury surveillance via programs such as 
      the High School Reporting Information Online system and the National Collegiate
      Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program has aided the acquisition of
      wrestling injury data. Objective: To describe the epidemiology of injuries
      sustained in high school boys' wrestling in the 2005–2006 through 2013–2014
      academic years and collegiate men's wrestling in the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 
      academic years using Web-based sports injury surveillance. Design: Descriptive
      epidemiology study. Setting: Online injury surveillance from wrestling teams of
      high school boys (annual average = 100) and collegiate men (annual average = 11).
      Patients or Other Participants: Male wrestlers who participated in practices and 
      competitions during the 2005–2006 through 2013–2014 academic years in high school
      or the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 academic years in college. Main Outcome
      Measure(s): Athletic trainers collected time-loss (≥24 hours) injuries and
      exposure data during this time period. Injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures
      (AEs), injury rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and injury proportions
      by body site and diagnosis were calculated. Results: The High School Reporting
      Information Online documented 3376 time-loss injuries during 1 416 314 AEs; the
      National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program documented
      2387 time-loss injuries during 257 297 AEs. The total injury rate was higher in
      college than in high school (9.28 versus 2.38/1000 AEs; injury rate ratio = 3.89;
      95% confidence interval = 3.69, 4.10). In high school, the most commonly injured 
      body parts for both practices and competitions were the head/face (practices =
      19.9%, competitions = 21.4%) and shoulder/clavicle (practices = 14.1%,
      competitions = 21.0%). In college, the most frequently injured body parts for
      both practices and competitions were the knee (practices = 16.7%, competitions = 
      30.4%) and head/face (practices = 12.1%, competitions = 14.6%). Conclusions:
      Injury rates were higher in collegiate than in high school players, and the types
      of injuries sustained most often differed. Based on these results, continued
      study of primary and secondary prevention of injury in wrestlers across levels of
      competition is warranted.

      study. Setting: Online injury surveillance of ice hockey teams of high school
      boys (annual average = 34), collegiate men (annual average = 20), and collegiate 
      women (annual average = 11). Patients or Other Participants: Boys', men's, and

      the 2008–2009 through 2013–2014 high school academic years or the 2004–2005
      through 2013–2014 collegiate academic years. Main Outcome Measure(s): Athletic
      trainers collected time-loss (≥24 hours) injury and exposure data. We calculated 
      injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), injury rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs), and injury proportions by body site and diagnosis.
      Results: The High School Reporting Information Online system documented 831 boys'
      ice hockey time-loss injuries during 356 997 AEs; the National Collegiate
      Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program documented 2611 men's ice hockey
      time-loss injuries during 552 642 AEs and 752 women's ice hockey injuries during 
      232 051 AEs. Injury rates were higher in collegiate men than in high school boys 
      during 2008–2009 through 2013–2014 (4.38 versus 2.33/1000 AEs; IRR = 1.88; 95% CI
      = 1.73, 2.05) and collegiate women during 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 (IRR =
      1.46; 95% CI = 1.34, 1.58). Most injuries occurred during competitions (boys =
      80.0%, men = 66.9%, women = 55.3%); injury rates were higher in competitions than
      in practices for boys (IRR = 8.14; 95% CI = 6.87, 9.65), men (IRR = 6.58; 95% CI 
      = 6.06, 7.13), and women (IRR = 3.63; 95% CI = 3.14, 4.19). At all levels, most
      injuries occurred to the head/face and shoulder/clavicle and resulted in
      concussions, contusions, or ligament sprains. Conclusions: Injury rates varied
      across sports but were consistently higher in competitions than in practices. In 
      competitions, concussions were common injuries, highlighting the need for
      continued development of injury-prevention strategies.

PG  - 1156-65
AB  - Context: Aerobic exercise interventions are increasingly being prescribed for
      concussion rehabilitation, but whether aerobic training protocols influence
      clinical concussion diagnosis and management assessments is unknown. Objective:
      To investigate the effects of a brief aerobic exercise intervention on clinical
      concussion outcomes in healthy, active participants. Design: Randomized
      controlled clinical trial. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants:
      Healthy (uninjured) participants (n = 40) who exercised ≥3 times/week.
      Intervention(s): Participants were randomized into the acute concussion therapy
      intervention (ACTIVE) training or nontraining group. All participants completed
      symptom, cognitive, balance, and vision assessments during 2 test sessions
      approximately 14 days apart. Participants randomized to ACTIVE training completed
      six 30-minute exercise sessions that progressed from 60% to 80% of individualized
      maximal oxygen consumption (V˙o2max) across test sessions, while the nontraining 
      group received no intervention. Main Outcome Measure(s): The CNS Vital Signs
      standardized scores, Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening near-point convergence
      distance (cm), and Graded Symptom Checklist, Balance Error Scoring System, and
      Standardized Assessment of Concussion total scores. Results: An interaction
      effect was found for total symptom score (P = .01); the intervention group had
      improved symptom scores between sessions (session 1: 5.1 ± 5.8; session 2: 1.9 ± 
      3.6). Cognitive flexibility, executive functioning, reasoning, and total symptom 
      score outcomes were better but composite memory, verbal memory, and near-point
      convergence distance scores were worse at the second session (all P values <
      .05). However, few changes exceeded the 80% reliable change indices calculated
      for this study, and effect sizes were generally small to negligible. Conclusions:
      A brief aerobic training protocol had few meaningful effects on clinical
      concussion assessment in healthy participants, suggesting that current
      concussion-diagnostic and -assessment tools remain clinically stable in response 
      to aerobic exercise training. This provides normative data for future
      researchers, who should further evaluate the effect of ACTIVE training on
      clinical outcomes among concussed populations. Trial Registration Number:

TI  - Nutritional quality of meals and snacks served and consumed in family child care.
PG  - 2280-6
AB  - Background.Improving the nutritional quality of food, including beverages, served
      in early care and education settings should enhance children’s diet quality.
      However, few studies have explored the relationship between what is served and
      consumed in family child care homes (FCCH). Objective.To describe the nutritional
      quality of food served to children in FCCH and to assess the extent to which
      children eat what is served. Design.This study was a cross-sectional analysis
      using baseline data (n=166) from a cluster-randomized-controlled trial (2013 to
      2016). Participants/setting.Eligible FCCH’s in central North Carolina had to have
      at least two children between 18-months-four years, have been in business for at 
      least two years, and serve at least one meal and one snack. Main outcome
      measures.Food was captured using the Diet Observation at Child Care protocol.
      Statistical analyses.Frequencies, means, and multivariate analysis were used to
      examine the relationship between food served and consumed by food groups, and by 
      Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010). Results.Children consumed between 61–80% of what
      was served, with vegetables, having the lowest percent consumed (61.0%). Total
      HEI-2010 score for food served was 63.6 (10.4) and for food consumed was 61.7
      (11.5), out of a 100-point maximum. With regards to food served, FCCH providers
      came close to meeting HEI-2010 standards for dairy, whole fruit, total fruit and 
      empty calories. However, providers appeared to fall short when it came to green
      and beans, seafood/plant proteins, total vegetables, whole grains, and fatty
      acids. They also exceeded recommended limits for sodium, and refined grains.
      Conclusions.While FCCH’s are serving some healthy food, mainly fruit, dairy and
      few empty calories, there is room for improvement with regards to vegetables,
      grains, seafood and plant protein, fatty acids, and sodium. Future trainings
      should help providers find ways to increase the serving and consumption of these 
      foods.

TI  - Risk Factors for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Surrogate
      Decision-Makers of Patients with Chronic Critical Illness.
PG  - 1451-8
AB  - Rationale: Chronically critically ill patients are often dependent on family
      members for surrogate decision-making, and these surrogates are at high risk for 
      emotional distress. We hypothesized that patient- and surrogate-specific risk
      factors for surrogate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms can be
      identified early in the course of chronic critical illness.Objectives: To
      identify risk factors for PTSD symptoms in surrogate decision-makers of
      chronically critically ill patients.Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of
      the database from a multicenter randomized trial of a communication intervention 
      for chronic critical illness patients and surrogates. Variables preselected for
      plausible mechanism for increasing PTSD symptoms and identifiable by Day 10 of
      mechanical ventilation were included in the analysis for association with
      surrogate PTSD symptoms at 90 days, as measured by the Impact of Events
      Score–Revised (IES-R). Patient factors included demographics, insurance status,
      baseline functional status, chronic comorbidities, illness severity, and presence
      of advance directive. Surrogate variables included demographics, education level 
      and employment, religion, relationship to patient, and Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale score measured at enrollment. Multivariable linear regression
      models were then constructed for 26 potential risk factors, including
      biologically or mechanistically plausible confounders for each, with IES-R score 
      as the outcome. All models were adjusted for multiple respondents, using a mixed 
      model, considering the patients as a random factor.Results: Our analysis included
      306 surrogates for 224 patients. A total of 49% of patients were female, and mean
      age was 59 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 56.4–60.7). A total of 71% of
      surrogates were female, and mean age was 51 years (95% CI, 49.3–52.4). After
      examining each potential risk factor in a separate multivariable model, only
      Day-10 surrogate Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score (β
      coefficient = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.73–1.30) and patient unresponsiveness (β
      coefficient = 8.39; 95% CI, 0.83–15.95) were associated with higher IES-R
      scores.Conclusions: Among surrogate decision-makers for chronically critically
      ill patients, high anxiety and depression scores and patient unresponsiveness on 
      or near Day 10 of mechanical ventilation are risk factors for PTSD symptoms at 90
      days.

TI  - Diagnostic Thresholds for Blood Pressure Measured at Home in the Context of the
      2017 Hypertension Guideline: Analysis from 2 US Cohorts.
PG  - 1312-9
AB  - Most guidelines have recommended lower home BP threshold when clinic BP threshold
      of 140/90 mm Hg is used for diagnosis of hypertension. However, home BP
      thresholds to define hypertension have never been determined in the general
      population in the United States. We identified home BP thresholds for stage 1 (BP
      ≥ 130/80 mmHg) hypertension using a regression-based approach in the Dallas Heart
      Study (n=5,768) and the North Carolina Masked Hypertension study (n = 420). Home 
      BP thresholds were also assessed using outcome-derived approach based on the
      composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events in the Dallas Heart
      Study cohort. For this approach, BP thresholds were identified only for systolic 
      BP as diastolic BP was not associated with the outcome. Among untreated
      participants, the regression-derived thresholds for home BP corresponding to
      clinic BP for stage 1 hypertension were 129/80 mmHg in Blacks, 130/80 mmHg in
      Whites, and 126/78 mmHg in Hispanics, respectively. The results are similar in
      the North Carolina cohort. The 11-year composite cardiovascular and mortality
      events corresponding to clinic systolic BP > 130 mmHg were higher in Blacks than 
      Whites and Hispanics (13.3% vs. 5.98% vs. 5.52%, respectively). Using a
      race/ethnicity-specific composite outcome in the untreated DHS participants, the 
      outcome-derived home systolic BP thresholds corresponding to stage 1 hypertension
      were 130 mmHg in Blacks, 129 mmHg in Whites, and 131 mmHg in Hispanics,
      respectively. Our data based on both regression-derived and outcome approach
      support home BP threshold of 130/80 mmHg for diagnosis of hypertension in Blacks,
      Whites, and Hispanics.

TI  - Effects of Pathways Triple P on Pediatric Health-Related Quality of Life in
      Maltreated Children.
PG  - 701-8
AB  - Objective: Child maltreatment is an adverse childhood experience associated with 
      reductions in child well-being. This study examines whether an evidence-based
      parenting intervention delivered to families served by the child welfare system
      impacts pediatric health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Method: This study is a
      randomized-controlled trial of Pathways Triple P delivered to families with open 
      child welfare cases for child physical abuse or neglect (N =119). Children were 5
      to 11 years old and remained in the home following the investigation. The primary
      outcome measure for this study was the PedsQL 4.0, which measures HRQoL across 4 
      subdomains: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and 
      school functioning. Child and caregiver-reported PedsQL 4.0 were assessed at
      baseline and at post-test following the 14-week intervention. Results:
      Controlling for other factors, children in families randomly assigned to the
      Pathways Triple P condition had a significant improvement in overall
      health-related HRQoL following the intervention, compared to families receiving
      usual services (βchild-report = 6.08, SE = 2.77, P = .03; βparent-report = 3.83, 
      SE = 1.88, P = .04). Subdomain effect sizes differed when considering child
      self-report or parent proxy report. Child self-report yielded the largest
      improvement in emotional functioning while social functioning had the largest
      gain based on parent proxy report. Conclusion: The Pathways Triple P parenting
      intervention was associated with higher pediatric health-related quality-of-life,
      as reported by both the child and the caregiver. This intervention holds promise 
      to improve child well-being when implemented in the child welfare system.

TI  - Child Neurodevelopmental Outcomes by Prepregnancy Body Mass Index and Gestational
      Weight Gain.
PG  - 1386-93
AB  - Objective:: To study the association of pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and
      gestational weight gain with child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods:: We
      performed a secondary analysis of data from two parallel, multicenter,
      randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, thyroxine replacement trials in
      pregnant women with either hypothyroxinemia or subclinical hypothyroidism who
      delivered at term. Body mass index was categorized as normal (18.5–24.9kg/m2),
      overweight (25.0–29.9kg/m2), or obese (≥30kg/m2). We also evaluated early (≤20
      weeks), late (>20 weeks) and total gestational weight gain and categorized
      gestational weight gain as inadequate, adequate, and excessive per 2009 Institute
      of Medicine guidelines. Neurodevelopmental outcomes included 5-year WPPSI-III and
      3-year Differential Ability Scales-II (DAS-II). Linear and logistic regression
      analyses were performed and adjusted for maternal age, race–ethnicity, education,
      insurance status, parity, smoking and alcohol use, thyroid status (subclinical
      hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia), treatment group, gestational age at
      delivery, and infant sex. Results:: Of the 948 women included, 380(40%), 305(32%)
      and 263(28%) had normal, overweight, and obese prepregnancy BMI, respectively. A 
      total of 106(11%), 212(22%), and 630(66%) of women had inadequate, adequate, and 
      excessive total rates of gestational weight gain, respectively. Maternal
      differences among the BMI categories included race–ethnicity, education,
      insurance type, parity, and thyroid status (all p<0.01) whereas the gestational
      weight gain groups only differed by parity (p<0.001). In unadjusted analysis,
      children of obese (93.2±12.8; 88.5±13.3) and overweight (94.1±15.6; 89.6±16.0)
      women had lower WPPSI-III and DAS-II scores, respectively than normal weight
      women (97.4±15.4; 93.9±16.0; p<0.001 for all comparisons); however, in adjusted
      analysis, there were no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes by maternal
      BMI. The association was primarily accounted for by race-ethnicity and education.
      In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there were no differences in
      neurodevelopmental outcomes by adequacy of early, late, or total gestational
      weight gain. Conclusion:: In women with either subclinical hypothyroidism or
      hypothyroxinemia, neither prepregnancy BMI nor gestational weight gain were
      associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes among children born at term in
      adjusted analyses.

TI  - ACUTE HIV INFECTION AND CD4/CD8 RATIO NORMALIZATION AFTER ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY 
      INITIATION.
PG  - 510-8
AB  - Background:: We estimated the effect of initiating virologically suppressive ART 
      during acute versus chronic HIV infection (AHI, CHI) on CD4/CD8 ratio
      normalization. Setting:: A prospective clinical cohort study. Methods:: We
      included patients initiating ART with AHI and CHI between 2000 and 2015 and
      compared time from ART initiation to the first normal CD4/CD8 ratio (defined as
      CD4/CD8 ≥1) using Kaplan Meier curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
      models. Patient time was censored at virologic failure, lost to follow-up or
      death. We also characterized CD4, CD8, and CD4/CD8 trajectories over the first
      three years of ART. Results:: The 1198 patients were 27% female and 60% African
      American, with a median age of 37 years (IQR 28, 47) at ART initiation. The 83
      AHI patients were more likely male, younger, and of white race, than CHI
      patients. After 2 years of suppressive ART, 70% of AHI patients achieved a normal
      CD4/CD8 ratio, compared to 6–38% of CHI patients, with greater likelihood of
      normalization at higher baseline CD4 counts. Time to normalization was shortest
      among AHI patients, followed by CHI patients with higher baseline CD4. The
      adjusted HR for time to normalization for AHI patients compared to CHI patients
      with baseline CD4>350 was 4.33 (95% CI 3.16, 5.93). Higher baseline CD4/CD8 ratio
      was also associated with time to normalization (adjusted HR 1.54; 1.46, 1.63, per
      0.1 increase in ratio). Conclusion:: Initiating ART during AHI, at higher
      baseline CD4 cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratios was associated with shorter time to
      CD4/CD8 ratio normalization.

TI  - Receiving HIV Serostatus Disclosure from Partners Before Sex: Results from an
      Online Survey of Chinese Men Who Have Sex with Men.
PG  - 3826-35
AB  - Background: HIV serostatus disclosure before sex can facilitate serosorting,
      condom use and potentially decrease the risk of HIV acquisition. However, few
      studies have evaluated HIV serostatus disclosure from partners before sex. We
      examined the rate and correlates of receiving HIV serostatus disclosure from
      regular and casual male partners before sex among an online sample of men who
      have sex with men (MSM) in China. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was
      conducted among MSM in eight Chinese cities in July 2016. Participants completed 
      questions covering sociodemographic information, sexual behaviors, HIV testing
      (including HIV self-testing) history, self-reported HIV status, and post-test
      violence. In addition, participants were asked whether they received HIV
      serostatus disclosure from their most recent partners before sex. Results:
      Overall, 2105 men completed the survey. Among them, 85.9% were never married, and
      35.4% had high school or less education. A minority (20.6%, 346/1678; 17.8%,
      287/1608) of men received HIV serostatus disclosure from their most recent
      regular and casual male partners, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated
      that participants who ever self-tested for HIV were more likely to have received 
      HIV status disclosure from regular [adjusted OR (aOR)=1.92, 95% CI: 1.50–2.44]
      and casual (aOR=2.34, 95% CI: 1.80–3.04) male partners compared to never
      self-tested participants. Compared to participants who had not received HIV
      status disclosure from regular partners, participants who received disclosure
      from regular male partners had higher likelihood in experiencing post-test
      violence (aOR =5.18, 95% CI: 1.53–17.58). Similar results were also found for
      receiving HIV serostatus disclosure from casual partners. Conclusion: This study 
      showed that HIV serostatus disclosure from partners was uncommon among Chinese
      MSM. Interventions and further implementation research to facilitate safe
      disclosure are urgently needed for MSM.

TI  - HIV-related stigma, social support, and psychological distress among individuals 
      initiating ART in Ethiopia.
PG  - 3815-25
AB  - Recent World Health Organization (WHO) HIV treatment guideline expansion may
      facilitate timely antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. However, large-scale
      success of universal treatment strategies requires a more comprehensive
      understanding of known barriers to early ART initiation. This work aims to
      advance a more comprehensive understanding of interrelationships among three
      known barriers to ART initiation: psychological distress, HIV-related stigma, and
      low social support. We analyzed cross-sectional interview data on 1175 adults
      initiating ART at six HIV treatment clinics in Ethiopia. Experience of each form 
      of HIV-related stigma assessed (e.g., anticipatory, internalized, and enacted)
      was associated with increased odds of psychological distress. However, among
      those who reported enacted HIV-related stigma, there was no significant
      association between social support and psychological distress. Interventions to
      improve mental health among people living with HIV should consider incorporating 
      components to address stigma, focusing on strategies to prevent or reduce the
      internalization of stigma, given the magnitude of the relationship between high
      internalized stigma and psychological distress. Interventions to increase social 
      support may be insufficient to improve the mental health of people living with
      HIV who experienced enacted HIV-related stigma. Future research should examine
      alternative strategies to manage the mental health consequences of enacted
      HIV-related stigma, including coping skills training.

TI  - Predicting diabetes risk among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.
PG  - 2767-75
AB  - Objective:: To assess the performance of an adapted American Diabetes Association
      (ADA) risk score and the concise Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINRISC) for
      predicting type 2 diabetes development in women with and at risk of HIV
      infection. Design:: Longitudinal analysis of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study.
      Methods:: The women’s Interagency HIV Study is an ongoing prospective cohort
      study of women with and at risk for HIV infection. Women without prevalent
      diabetes and 3- year data on fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, self-reported
      diabetes medication use, and self-reported diabetes were included. ADA and
      FINRISC scores were computed at baseline and their ability to predict diabetes
      development within 3 years was assessed [sensitivity, specificity and area under 
      the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve]. Results:: 1111
      HIV-positive (median age 41, 60% African American) and 454 HIV-negative women
      (median age 38, 63% African American) were included. ADA sensitivity did not
      differ between HIV-positive (77%) and HIV-negative women (81%), while specificity
      was better in HIV-negative women (42% vs. 49%, p=0.006). Overall ADA
      discrimination was suboptimal in both HIV-positive (AUROC=0.64 [95% CI: 0.58,
      0.70]) and HIV-negative women (AUROC=0.67 [95% CI: 0.57, 0.77]). FINRISC
      sensitivity and specificity did not differ between HIV-positive (72% and 49%,
      respectively) and HIV-negative women (86% and 52%, respectively). Overall FINRISC
      discrimination was suboptimal in HIV-positive (AUROC=0.68 [95% CI: 0.62, 0.75])
      and HIV-negative women (AUROC=0.78 [95% CI: 0.66, 0.90]). Conclusions:: Model
      performance was suboptimal in women with and at risk of HIV, while greater
      misclassification was generally observed among HIV-positive women. HIV-specific
      risk factors known to contribute to diabetes risk should be explored in these
      models.

      suppression and engagement in Option B+.
PG  - 2827-33
AB  - Objective: To estimate the association of probable antenatal depression with
      postpartum HIV care engagement among pregnant women in Malawi. Design: We
      conducted a prospective cohort study of 299 women who were initiating
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) through Option B+ at a government antenatal clinic
      in Malawi. Methods: Probable antenatal depression was assessed on the day of ART 
      initiation with the validated Chichewa version of the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS). We estimated crude and adjusted risk differences (RD,
      aRD) of visit attendance and prevalence differences (PD, aPD) of viral
      suppression through 12 months post-ART initiation comparing women with versus
      without probable antenatal depression. Results: One in ten women had probable
      antenatal depression. Most women were engaged in care through 12 months post-ART 
      initiation: 85% attended all scheduled ART visits, and 81% were in care and
      virally suppressed. Women with and without probable antenatal depression had a
      comparable probability of attending all scheduled visits (RD: −0.02; 95%CI
      −0.16–0.12; aRD: −0.04; 95%CI −0.18–0.10), and of viral suppression (PD: −0.02;
      95%CI −0.17–0.13; aPD: −0.01; 95%CI −0.17–0.15) in crude and adjusted analyses.
      Conclusion: Probable antenatal depression was not associated with engagement in
      HIV care through 12 months post-ART initiation. In a population with high HIV
      care engagement, antenatal depression may not impair HIV-related outcomes.

TI  - A biomarker panel predicts progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal
      adenocarcinoma.
LID - doy102
AB  - Progression from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is
      uncommon but the consequences are serious. Predictors of progression are
      essential to optimize resource utilization. This study assessed the utility of a 
      promising panel of biomarkers applicable to routine paraffin embedded biopsies
      (FFPE) to predict progression of BE to EAC in a large population-based, nested
      case-control study.We utilized the Amsterdam-based ReBus nested case-control
      cohort. BE patients who progressed to high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/EAC (n = 130)
      and BE patients who never progressed (n = 130) were matched on age, sex, length
      of the BE segment, and duration of endoscopic surveillance. All progressors had
      minimum 2 years of endoscopic surveillance without HGD/EAC to exclude prevalent
      neoplasia. We assessed abnormal DNA content, p53, Cyclin A, and Aspergillus
      oryzae lectin (AOL) in FFPE sections. We performed conditional logistic
      regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) of progression based on biomarker
      status.Expert LGD (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 1.7–41.0), AOL (3 vs. 0 epithelial
      compartments abnormal; OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2–10.6) and p53 (OR, 2.3; 95% CI,
      1.2–4.6) were independently associated with neoplastic progression. Cyclin A did 
      not predict progression and DNA ploidy analysis by image cytometry was
      unsuccessful in the majority of cases, both were excluded from the multivariate
      analysis. The multivariable biomarker model had an area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve of 0.73.Expert LGD, AOL, and p53 independently
      predict neoplastic progression in BE patients and are applicable to routine
      practice. These biomarkers can aid in selecting patients for endoscopic ablation 
      or more intensive surveillance.

AB  - Background:: The GUIDing Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified
      Treatment in Heart Failure (GUIDE-IT) trial prospectively compared the efficacy
      of a NT-proBNP-guided heart failure treatment strategy (target NT-proBNP level
      <1000 pg/mL) with optimal medical therapy alone in high-risk patients with heart 
      failure and reduced ejection fraction. When the study was stopped for futility,
      894 patients had been enrolled. Objectives:: To assess treatment-related
      quality-of-life (QOL) and economic outcomes in GUIDE-IT. Methods:: We
      prospectively collected a battery of QOL instruments at baseline and 3, 6, 12,
      and 24 months post-randomization (collection rates 90% to 99% of those eligible).
      The principal prespecified QOL measures were the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy
      Questionnaire (KCCQ) Overall Summary Score and the Duke Activity Status Index
      (DASI). Cost data were collected for 735 (97%) of US patients. Results:: Baseline
      variables were well balanced in the 446 patients randomized to the
      NTproBNP-guided therapy and 448 to usual care. Both the KCCQ and the DASI
      improved over the first 6 months, but we found no evidence for a strategy-related
      difference [mean difference (biomarker-guided – usual care) at 24 months of
      follow-up 2.0 for DASI (95% CI −1.3 to 5.3) and 1.1 for KCCQ (95% CI −3.7 to
      5.9)]. Total winsorized costs averaged $5,919 higher in the biomarker-guided
      strategy (95% CI -$1,795, +$13,602) over 15 months median follow-up.
      Conclusions:: A strategy of NT-proBNP-guided HF therapy had higher total costs
      and was not more effective than usual care in improving QOL outcomes in patients 
      with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Condensed Abstract::
      Quality-of-life (QOL) and economic outcomes were assessed in the GUIDing Evidence
      Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure trial, which
      prospectively compared the efficacy of a NT-proBNP-guided heart failure treatment
      strategy with optimal medical therapy alone in high-risk patients with heart
      failure and reduced ejection fraction. A strategy of NT-proBNP-guided HF therapy 
      had higher total costs and was not more effective than usual care in improving
      QOL outcomes in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction.

TI  - Correlates of alcohol-related treatment among American Indians/Alaska Natives
      with lifetime alcohol use disorder.
PG  - 115-22
AB  - Purpose:: To describe sociodemographic and selected psychiatric disorder patterns
      and estimate correlates of seeking alcohol treatment among American Indians,
      Alaska Natives (AIAN) and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) with lifetime alcohol use
      disorder (AUD). Methods:: Data come from the 2012-2013 U.S. National
      Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III. We retrospectively
      identified participants who completed information on lifetime AUD, race/ethnicity
      and seeking alcohol treatment or help for AUD. We used a generalized linear model
      with a log link and Poisson distribution to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) among
      adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition
      lifetime AUD. We included the following correlates: race/ethnicity, sex, age,
      personal annual income, marital status, education, urban/rural status, U.S.
      region, any illegal drug use disorder, nicotine use disorder, select mood,
      anxiety, personality and trauma-related disorders. Results:: Among AIAN the
      prevalence of lifetime AUD was 46.6%. Among AIAN with lifetime AUD, 33.8% sought 
      alcohol-related treatment. Among individuals with lifetime AUD, AIAN were
      associated with greater alcohol-related treatment seeking compared to NHW (aPR = 
      1.41 [95% CI 1.26-1.58]). Among AIAN with AUD, being male and age 35-64 were
      statistically significant correlates of seeking treatment or help for AUD.
      Conclusions:: A relatively higher proportion of AIAN than NHW with alcohol use
      disorders sought alcohol treatment. Among individuals with lifetime AUD,
      significant demographic and psychiatric disorder correlates of treatment are
      present, showing that certain groups are less likely to seek treatment or help
      for alcohol-related issues. Among AIAN with AUD, these correlates may reflect
      distinct patterns of seeking alcohol-related treatment, which can inform more
      effective treatment promotion efforts with this population.

TI  - High Cancer Burden Among Antiretroviral Therapy Users in Malawi: A Record Linkage
      Study of Observational Human Immunodeficiency Virus Cohorts and Cancer Registry
      Data.
PG  - 829-35
AB  - Background: With antiretroviral therapy (ART), AIDS-defining cancer incidence has
      declined and non-AIDS–defining cancers (NADCs) are now more frequent among human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected populations in high-income countries. In
      sub-Saharan Africa, limited epidemiological data describe cancer burden among ART
      users. Methods: We used probabilistic algorithms to link cases from the
      population-based cancer registry with electronic medical records supporting ART
      delivery in Malawi’s 2 largest HIV cohorts from 2000–2010. Age-adjusted cancer
      incidence rates (IRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by cancer site,
      early vs late incidence periods (4–24 and >24 months after ART start), and World 
      Health Organization (WHO) stage among naive ART initiators enrolled for at least 
      90 days. Results: We identified 4346 cancers among 28 576 persons. Most people
      initiated ART at advanced WHO stages 3 or 4 (60%); 12% of patients had prevalent 
      malignancies at ART initiation, which were predominantly AIDS-defining
      eligibility criteria for initiating ART. Kaposi sarcoma (KS) had the highest IR
      (634.7 per 100 000 person-years) followed by cervical cancer (36.6). KS incidence
      was highest during the early period 4–24 months after ART initiation. NADCs
      accounted for 6% of new cancers. Conclusions: Under historical ART guidelines,
      NADCs were observed at low rates and were eclipsed by high KS and cervical cancer
      burden. Cancer burden among Malawian ART users does not yet mirror that in
      high-income countries. Integrated cancer screening and management in HIV clinics,
      especially for KS and cervical cancer, remain important priorities in the current
      Malawi context.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 is a diagnostic and therapeutic target for early
      stage lung adenocarcinoma.
LID - eaat5933
AB  - The diagnostic definition of indeterminate lung nodules as malignant or benign
      poses a major challenge for clinicians. We discovered a potential marker, the
      sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2), whose activity identified metabolically
      active lung premalignancy and early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). We found
      that SGLT2 is expressed early in lung tumorigenesis and is found specifically in 
      pre-malignant lesions and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. Of note, SGLT2
      activity could be detected in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) with the
      tracer methyl-4-[18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (Me4FDG), which specifically detects
      SGLT activity. Using a combination of immunohistochemistry and Me4FDG PET, we
      identified high expression and functional activity of SGLT2 in lung premalignancy
      and early-stage/low-grade LADC. Furthermore, selective targeting of SGLT2 with
      FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors, the gliflozins, greatly reduced tumor
      growth and prolonged survival in autochthonous mouse models and patient-derived
      xenografts of LADC. Targeting SGLT2 in lung tumors may intercept lung cancer
      progression at early stages of development by pairing Me4FDG PET imaging with
      therapy using SGLT2 inhibitors.

TI  - New antiretroviral agent use affects prevalence of HIV drug resistance in
      clinical care populations.
PG  - 2593-603
AB  - Objective:: To estimate the prevalence of HIV drug resistance over time and
      identify risk factors for multi-class resistance.Design: Prospective clinical
      cohort of HIV-infected patients at the University of North Carolina. Methods::
      Among ART-experienced patients in care 2000–2016, we estimated annual prevalences
      of cumulative resistance, defined as ≥1 major mutation, by drug class. Clinical
      data and multiple imputation were used when genotypic data was missing, and
      mutations were carried forward in time. We estimated resistance odds ratios
      comparing characteristics of patients in care in 2016. Results:: 3,682 patients
      contributed 23,169 person-years. Prevalence of ≥1 major resistance mutation,
      irrespective of viral suppression, peaked in 2005 with 49% (95% CI 46, 52) and
      decreased to 38% (35, 40) in 2016. Resistance to NRTIs, PIs, and NNRTIs also
      peaked in 2005–2007 and decreased to 28% (26, 31), 14% (12, 16), and 27% (24, 29)
      in 2016, respectively. In 2016, prevalence of INSTI resistance was 2% (1, 3) and 
      triple-class resistance 10% (9, 12). Over the study period, cumulative resistance
      was frequent among patients with detectable viremia, but uncommon among patients 
      initiating ART post-2007. Among 1,553 patients in care in 2016, ART initiation at
      an older age, with an INSTI, and with higher CD4 were associated with resistance 
      to fewer or no classes. Conclusion:: Prevalence of resistance to older ART
      classes has decreased in the last ten years in this clinical cohort, while INSTI 
      resistance has increased but remained very low. Patients with viremia continue to
      have a high burden of resistance even if they initiated ART recently.

TI  - Targeting B-Cell Maturation Antigen with GSK2857916 Antibody-Drug Conjugate in
      Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma: A Dose-Escalation and Expansion Phase 1 
      Trial (BMA117159).
PG  - 1641-53
AB  - Background:: B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a tumour necrosis superfamily
      cell-surface receptor required for plasma cell survival. This study evaluated
      safety, tolerability and preliminary clinical activity of GSK2857916, a novel
      anti-BCMA antibody conjugated to microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl
      auristatin-F, in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).
      Methods:: This international, multicentre, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1
      study comprised dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2) phases.
      Adults with histologically or cytologically confirmed MM, Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group performance status 0/1, and progressive disease following stem
      cell transplant, alkylators, proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators were
      recruited. In Part 1, patients received GSK2857916 (0 03–4 6 mg/kg) via 1-hour
      intravenous infusion. In Part 2, patients received the selected dose of
      GSK2857916 (3 4 mg/kg) every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). All patients who received ≥1 dose
      were included in this prespecified administrative interim analysis (cut-off: 26
      June 2017), which was performed for internal purposes. The study is ongoing
      (NCT02064387). Findings:: Between July 2014 and February 2017, 73 patients were
      treated (Part 1 n=38; Part 2 n=35). No MTD was identified in Part 1. Based on
      safety/clinical activity, 3 4 mg/kg was selected as RP2D. Corneal events were
      common (42/73; 58%); most (37/42) were Grade 1/2 and did not result in treatment 
      discontinuation in Part 2. The other most common Grade 3/4 events were
      thrombocytopenia (25/73; 34%) and anaemia (11/73; 15%). There were 12
      treatmentrelated serious adverse events and no treatment-related deaths. Overall 
      response rate at 3 4 mg/kg in Part 2 was 60% (21/35; 95% confidence interval: 42 
      1%–76 1%). Interpretation:: At the identified RP2D, GSK2857916 is well tolerated 
      and data suggest it has good clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients,
      thereby indicating that this may be a promising candidate for the treatment of
      relapsed/refractory MM. Funding:: GlaxoSmithKline plc

TI  - Evaluating the urban-rural paradox: The complicated relationship between distance
      and the receipt of guideline-concordant care among cervical cancer patients.
PG  - 112-8
AB  - Objective:: Urban-rural health disparities are often attributed to the longer
      distances rural patients travel to receive care. However, a recent study suggests
      that distance to care may affect urban and rural cancer patients differentially. 
      We examined whether this urban-rural paradox exists among patients with cervical 
      cancer. Methods:: We identified individuals diagnosed with cervical cancer from
      2004–2013 using a statewide cancer registry linked to multi-payer, insurance
      claims. Our primary outcome was receipt of guideline-concordant care: surgery for
      stages IA1-IB1; external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), concomitant chemotherapy,
      and brachytherapy for stages IB2-IVA. We estimated risk ratios (RR) using
      modified Poisson regressions, stratified by urban/rural location, to examine the 
      association between distance to nearest facility and receipt of treatment.
      Results:: 62% of 999 cervical cancer patients received guideline-concordant care.
      The association between distance and receipt of care differed by type of
      treatment. In urban areas, cancer patients who lived ≥15 miles from the nearest
      surgical facility were less likely to receive primary surgical management
      compared to those <5 miles from the nearest surgical facility (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 
      0.60–0.98). In rural areas, patients living ≥15 miles from the nearest
      brachytherapy facility were more likely to receive treatment compared to those <5
      miles from the nearest brachytherapy facility (RR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.14–2.58).
      Distance was not associated with the receipt of chemotherapy or EBRT.
      Conclusions:: Among cervical cancer patients, there is evidence supporting the
      urban-rural paradox, i.e., geographic distance to cancer care facilities is not
      consistently associated with treatment receipt in expected or consistent ways.
      Healthcare systems must consider the diverse and differential barriers
      encountered by urban and rural residents to improve access to high quality cancer
      care.

TI  - Co-occurrence of early diabetes-related complications in adolescents and young
      adults with type 1 diabetes: the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study.
PG  - 35-43
AB  - Background.One in three adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes have at
      least one early diabetes-related complication/comorbidity. However, the
      prevalence, patterning, and risk factors for co-occurring complications in this
      population are not well understood. Methods.The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth
      observational cohort study includes 1327 individuals diagnosed with type 1
      diabetes before 20 years of age from 5 United States locations. Sociodemographic 
      and metabolic risk factors were assessed at baseline (mean diabetes duration =
      0·8 years, mean age = 10·9 years) and follow-up (mean diabetes duration = 7.8
      years, mean age = 18·0 years). Early diabetes complications (diabetic kidney
      disease, diabetic retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular autonomic
      neuropathy, and arterial stiffness) were assessed at follow-up. We aimed to
      describe co-occurrence of complications and examine differences in co-occurrence 
      within demographic and metabolic risk factor clusters identified using cluster
      analysis. Findings.Overall, co-occurrence of any ≥2 complications was observed in
      5·9% of all participants, more frequently than expected by chance alone (4·4%,
      p=0·015). Specifically, retinopathy and diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy and 
      arterial stiffness, and arterial stiffness and cardiac autonomic neuropathy all
      co-occurred more frequently than expected (all p<0·05). The cluster analysis
      produced four unique clusters characterized by progressively worsening metabolic 
      risk factor profiles (longer duration; higher A1c, non-HDL cholesterol, and waist
      to height ratio) and differences in sociodemographic characteristics
      (race/ethnicity, household income, type of health insurance). Prevalence of ≥2
      complications progressively increased with worsening metabolic profiles (from
      2·3% to 20·8%, p<0·001). Interpretation.We report that early complications
      co-occur in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes more frequently
      than expected after an average of less than eight years of diabetes duration. A
      cluster of high risk factors identifies groups that may benefit most from
      interventions to reduce complications.

TI  - Low Levels of Physical Activity Among Older Persons Living with HIV/AIDS Are
      Associated with Poor Physical Function.
PG  - 929-35
AB  - Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has prolonged lives of persons living with HIV/AIDS 
      (PLWHA), resulting in greater incidence of aging-related diseases and disability.
      Physical activity (PA) is recommended for healthy aging, but little is known
      about PA in older PLWHA. The purpose of this study was to objectively assess PA
      levels in older PLWHA and the associations with physical function. Twenty-one
      PLWHA, ≥50 years old, on ART with undetectable HIV-1 viral loads, wore an
      accelerometer to assess PA, including number of steps, activity intensity, and
      energy expenditure over 7 days. A physical function performance battery assessing
      aerobic capacity, strength, and gait speed was also completed. Average age was
      66, and 67% were male. An average of 3,442 (interquartile range: 4,613) steps
      were walked daily, with 254.9 kcals expended. Participants spent most waking
      hours (75%) sedentary, with minimal hours (24%) in light-intensity activity. Only
      5 min per day (35 min per week), on average, were spent in moderate-to-vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA). Maximal gait speed and 6-min walk test significantly
      correlated (p < .05) with all PA outcomes. Usual gait speed significantly
      correlated with all PA outcomes, except for daily kcals and light-intensity
      activity. Greater PA was associated with better physical performance, while high 
      sedentary time was associated with poorer performance. To our knowledge, this is 
      the first study to objectively measure PA in older PLWHA. Our findings indicate
      that older PLWHA accumulate substantial sedentary time. Most (86%) do not achieve
      recommended MVPA levels. This activity profile was associated with poor physical 
      function. Providers should promote PA among PLWHA.

TI  - Development of a Malawi Intensive care Mortality risk Evaluation (MIME) model, a 
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - Introduction:: Intensive care medicine can contribute to population health in
      low-income countries by reducing premature mortality related to surgery, trauma, 
      obstetrical and other medical emergencies. Quality improvement is guided by risk 
      stratification models, which are developed primarily within high-income settings.
      Models validated for use in low-income countries are needed. Methods:: This
      prospective cohort study consisted of 261 patients admitted to the intensive care
      unit (ICU) of K***** Central Hospital in Malawi, from September 2016 to March
      2018. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We performed univariable
      analyses on putative predictors and included those with a significance of 0.15 in
      the Malawi Intensive care Mortality risk Evaluation model (MIME). Model
      discrimination was evaluated using the area under the curve. Results:: Males made
      up 37.9% of the study sample and the mean age was 34.4 years. A majority (73.9%) 
      were admitted to the ICU after a recent surgical procedure, and 59% came directly
      from the operating theater. In-hospital mortality was 60.5%. The MIME based on
      age, sex, admitting service, systolic pressure, altered mental status, and fever 
      during the ICU course had a fairly good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.70 (95% 
      CI 0.63–0.76). Conclusions:: The MIME has modest ability to predict in-hospital
      mortality in a Malawian ICU. Multicenter research is needed to validate the MIME 
      and assess its clinical utility.

TI  - HIV Risk Characteristics Associated with Violence Against Women: A Longitudinal
      Study Among Women in the United States.
PG  - 1317-26
AB  - Background: Using data from HIV Prevention Trials Network 064, a multisite,
      observational cohort study conducted to estimate HIV incidence rates among women 
      living in areas of high poverty and HIV prevalence in the United States, we
      examined the use of HIV risk characteristics to predict emotional abuse, physical
      violence, and forced sex.Methods: Participants included 2099 women, 18–44 years
      of age, who reported unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a male partner and an
      additional personal or perceived male partner HIV risk characteristic in the past
      6 months. Adjusting for time-varying covariates, generalized estimating equations
      were used to assess the ability of HIV risk characteristics to predict violence 6
      months later.Results: Reported analyses were limited to the 1980 study
      participants who reported having a male sex partner at that assessment.
      Exchanging sex, perceived partner concurrency, and perceived partner
      incarceration were significantly predictive of emotional abuse 6 months later
      (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.60; 1.59; 1.34, respectively). Prior sexually
      transmitted infection diagnosis, exchanging sex, and binge drinking were
      significantly predictive of physical violence 6 months later (AOR: 1.62; 1.71;
      1.47, respectively). None of the variables measured was significantly predictive 
      of forced sex.Conclusions: Strategies that address reducing violence against
      women should be studied further in the context of HIV prevention programs.

TI  - Estimating sizes of key populations at the national level: considerations for
      study design and analysis.
PG  - 795-803
AB  - Background:: National estimates of the sizes of key populations, including female
      sex workers, men who have sex with men, and transgender women are critical to
      inform national and international responses to the human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) pandemic. However, epidemiologic studies typically provide size estimates
      for only limited high priority geographic areas. This paper illustrates a
      two-stage approach to obtain a national key population size estimate in the
      Dominican Republic using available estimates and publicly available contextual
      information. Methods:: Available estimates of key population size in priority
      areas were augmented with targeted additional data collection in other areas. To 
      combine information from data collected at each stage, we used statistical
      methods for handling missing data, including inverse probability weights,
      multiple imputation, and augmented inverse probability weights. Results:: Using
      the augmented inverse probability weighting approach, which provides some
      protection against parametric model misspecification, we estimated that 3.7% (95%
      CI: 2.9, 4.7) of the total population of women in the Dominican Republic between 
      the ages of 15 and 49 were engaged in sex work, 1.2% (95% CI: 1.1, 1.3) of men
      ages 15 – 49 had sex with other men, and 0.19% (95% CI: 0.17, 0.21) of people
      assigned the male sex at birth were transgender. Conclusions:: Viewing the size
      estimation of key populations as a missing data problem provides a framework for 
      articulating and evaluating the assumptions necessary to obtain a national size
      estimate. In addition, this paradigm allows use of methods for missing data
      familiar to epidemiologists.

      premenopausal women.
PG  - 1145-53
AB  - Objective:: To study associations between dietary factors and circulating
      anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations among late premenopausal women.
      Design:: AMH concentrations were measured in serum samples collected at
      enrollment from 296 women (aged 35–45 years) in the Sister Study cohort. Usual
      dietary intakes in the past 12 months were assessed using a validated food
      frequency questionnaire. Dietary exposures of interest included macronutrients,
      dietary fat subtypes, fiber, and glycemic index. Multivariable linear regression 
      was used to evaluate associations between dietary variables and serum AMH
      concentrations. We also used nutrient density models to examine isocaloric
      replacement of macronutrients. Setting:: N/A Patients/Animals:: Women aged 35–45 
      years Interventions:: N/A Main outcome measures:: Serum AMH concentrations
      (ng/ml) Results:: AMH concentrations were positively associated with percentage
      of energy from carbohydrates (β per 5% calories=0.141 [95% CI: 0.023, 0.259];
      p-trend=0.019), and inversely associated with percentage of energy from fat (β
      per 5% calories=−0.152 [95% CI: −0.299, −0.004]; p-trend=0.044). In analyses of
      dietary fat subtypes, AMH decreased with increasing monounsaturated fatty acids
      (p-trend=0.082) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (p-trend=0.043), particularly ω−6
      fatty acids (p-trend=0.044), while no strong trend was observed for saturated
      fatty acids. Protein and alcohol intake were not strongly associated with AMH.
      Conclusions:: Our cross-sectional analyses in a sample of late premenopausal
      women suggest that dietary fat intake may be inversely associated with
      circulating AMH concentrations. Further research in prospective studies is
      warranted to evaluate dietary factors as potential modifiers of ovarian reserve.

      Epidemiology of Injuries in US High School Boys' Basketball (2005–2006 Through
      2013–2014) and National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Basketball
      (2004–2005 Through 2013–2014).
PG  - 1025-36
AB  - Context: The advent of Web-based sports injury surveillance via programs such as 
      the High School Reporting Information Online system and the National Collegiate
      Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program has aided the acquisition of
      boys' and men's basketball injury data. Objective: To describe the epidemiology
      of injuries sustained in high school boys' basketball in the 2005–2006 through
      2013–2014 academic years and collegiate men's basketball in the 2004–2005 through
      2013–2014 academic years using Web-based sports injury surveillance. Design:
      Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Online injury surveillance from
      basketball teams of high school boys (annual average = 100) and collegiate men
      (annual average = 55). Patients or Other Participants: Boys' and men's basketball
      players who participated in practices and competitions during the 2005–2006
      through 2013–2014 academic years in high school or the 2004–2005 through
      2013–2014 academic years in college. Main Outcome Measures: Athletic trainers
      collected time-loss (≥24 hours) injury and exposure data. Injury rates per 1000
      athlete-exposures (AEs) were calculated. Injury rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs) compared injury rates by school size or division, time
      in season, event type, and competition level. Results: The High School Reporting 
      Information Online system documented 3056 time-loss injuries during 1 977 480
      AEs; the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program
      documented 4607 time-loss injuries during 868 631 AEs. The injury rate was higher
      for college than for high school (5.30 versus 1.55/1000 AE; IRR = 3.43; 95% CI = 
      3.28, 3.59). The injury rate was higher for competitions than for practices in
      both high school (IRR = 2.38; 95% CI = 2.22, 2.56) and college (IRR = 2.02; 95%
      CI = 1.90, 2.14). The most common injuries at both levels were ligament sprains, 
      muscle/tendon strains, and concussions; most injuries affected the ankle, knee,
      and head/face. Injuries were most often caused by contact with another player or 
      noncontact mechanisms. Conclusions: Injury rates were greater among collegiate
      players compared with high school players and were greater during competitions
      than practices at both levels. Distributions of injuries by body part, diagnoses,
      and mechanisms of injury were similar, suggesting that athletes at both levels
      may benefit from similar injury-prevention strategies.

      Measure(s): Certified athletic trainers collected time-loss (≥24 hours) injury
      and exposure data. Injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs) were calculated.
      Injury rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to

      Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program documented 3887 time-loss
      injuries during 783 600 AEs. The injury rate was higher in college than in high
      school (4.96 versus 1.82/1000 AEs; IRR = 2.73; 95% CI = 2.60, 2.86). The injury
      rate was higher in competitions than in practices for both high school (IRR =
      3.03; 95% CI = 2.82, 3.26) and collegiate (IRR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.86, 2.12)
      players. The most common injuries at both levels were ligament sprains,
      concussions, and muscle/tendon strains; the majority of injuries affected the
      ankle, knee, and head/face. These injuries were often caused by contact with
      another player or a noncontact mechanism. Conclusions: Injury rates were higher
      in collegiate than in high school athletes and in competitions than in practices.
      Similarities in distributions of injuries by body parts, specific diagnoses, and 
      mechanisms of injury suggest that both levels may benefit from similar
      injury-prevention strategies.

TI  - ClinVar database of global familial hypercholesterolemia-associated DNA variants.
PG  - 1631-40
AB  - Accurate and consistent variant classification is imperative for incorporation of
      rapidly developing sequencing technologies into genomic medicine for improved
      patient care. An essential requirement for achieving standardized and reliable
      variant interpretation is data sharing, facilitated by a centralized open-source 
      database. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an exemplar of the utility of
      such a resource: it has a high incidence, a favorable prognosis with early
      intervention and treatment, and cascade screening can be offered to families if a
      causative variant is identified. ClinVar, an NCBI-funded resource, has become the
      primary repository for clinically relevant variants in Mendelian disease,
      including FH. Here, we present the concerted efforts made by the Clinical Genome 
      Resource, through the FH Variant Curation Expert Panel and global FH community,
      to increase submission of FH-associated variants into ClinVar. Variant-level data
      was categorized by submitter, variant characteristics, classification method and 
      available supporting data. To further reform interpretation of FH-associated
      variants, areas for improvement in variant submissions were identified and
      addressed; these include a need for more detailed submissions and submission of
      supporting variant-level data, both retrospectively and prospectively.
      Collaborating to provide thorough, reliable evidence-based variant interpretation
      will ultimately improve the care of FH patients.

TI  - Intentional Weight Loss for Overweight and Obese Knee Osteoarthritis Patients: Is
      More Better?
PG  - 1569-75
AB  - Objective: To determine the dose response to weight loss on clinical and
      mechanistic outcomes in overweight and obese adults with knee osteoarthritis.
      Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the diet-only (D) and diet plus exercise
      (D+E) groups in the Intensive Diet and Exercise for Arthritis (IDEA) randomized
      controlled clinical trial. Participants were 240 overweight and obese older
      community-dwelling adults with pain and radiographic knee OA. Participants were
      divided into 4 groups according to weight loss achieved over an 18-month period; 
      less than 5% (<5% group), between 5 and 10% (≥5% group), between 10 and 20% (≥
      10% group), and greater than 20% (≥20% group). Results: There were significant
      dose responses to weight loss for pain (p = 0.01), function (p = 0.0006),
      6-minute walk distance (p < 0.0001), physical (p = 0.0004) and mental (p = 0.03) 
      health- related quality of life (HRQL), knee joint compressive force (p <
      0.0001), and IL-6 (p = 0.002). Greater weight loss resulted in superior clinical 
      and mechanstic outcomes with the highest weight loss group (≥20% group)
      distinguishing itself on all measures compared to the <5% and ≥5% groups; the
      ≥20% group had 25% less pain and better function than the ≥ 10% group, and
      significantly (p = 0.006) better physical HRQL. Discussion: Long-term weight loss
      between 10–19.9% of baseline body weight has substantial clinical and mechanistic
      benefits compared to less weight loss; the value of an additional 10% weight loss
      includes significantly improved physical HRQL, and a clinically important
      reduction in pain and improvement in function.

TI  - Life’s Simple 7 and Peripheral Artery Disease Risk: The Atherosclerosis Risk in
      Communities Study.
PG  - 642-9
AB  - Introduction:: The American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 includes seven
      metrics of ideal cardiovascular health to target for cardiovascular disease
      prevention. This study determined the relationship between Life’s Simple 7 and
      incident peripheral artery disease in a biracial cohort of middle and older aged 
      adults. Methods:: This analysis included 12,865 participants from the
      Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study recruited between 1987 and 1989 (mean
      age=54 years, 55% women, 25% black) and free of peripheral artery disease or
      other cardiovascular disease at baseline. Overall, Life’s Simple 7 score was
      calculated as the sum of the Life’s Simple 7 component scores (two points if
      ideal, one point if intermediate, and zero if poor) and classified as inadequate 
      (zero to four), average (five to nine), or optimal (ten to 14) cardiovascular
      health and linked to incident peripheral artery disease identified by hospital
      discharge diagnosis and leg revascularization. Analysis was conducted in 2017.
      Results:: A total of 434 incident peripheral artery disease cases occurred over a
      median follow-up of 24.4 years. Compared with the inadequate category (n=1,008), 
      participants in the average (n=8,395) and optimal (n=3,462) categories each had a
      substantially lower risk of developing peripheral artery disease in a Cox
      proportional hazards model adjusted for potential confounders (hazard ratio=0.36,
      95% CI=0.28, 0.46 for average, and hazard ratio=0.09, 95% CI=0.06, 0.15 for
      optimal). In a similar model, a one-point higher Life’s Simple 7 score was
      associated with a 25% lower risk of incident peripheral artery disease (hazard
      ratio=0.75, 95% CI=0.72, 0.79). Conclusions:: Better cardiovascular health, as
      defined by higher Life’s Simple 7 score, is associated with a substantially lower
      risk of peripheral artery disease.

TI  - Antiretroviral drug use and HIV drug resistance among young women in rural South 
      Africa: HPTN 068.
PG  - 315-22
AB  - Background:: Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are used for HIV treatment and
      prevention. We analyzed ARV drug use and HIV drug resistance in a cohort of young
      women in rural South Africa enrolled in the HPTN 068 study, which evaluated use
      of a cash transfer conditional on school attendance to reduce HIV incidence.
      Methods:: ARV drug testing was performed using plasma samples from 2,526 young
      women. This included 2,526 enrollment samples (80 HIV-infected, 2,446
      HIV-uninfected) and 162 seroconversion samples (first HIV-positive study visit). 
      Testing was performed using a qualitative assay that detects 20 ARV drugs from
      five drug classes. HIV drug resistance testing was performed with the ViroSeq
      HIV-1 Genotyping System for samples that had HIV viral loads ≥400 copies/mL.
      Results:: At enrollment, ARV drugs were detected in 10 (12.5%) of 80 HIV-infected
      young women. None of 2,446 HIV-uninfected young women had ARV drugs detected at
      enrollment. ARV drugs were also detected in 16 (9.9%) of 162 seroconverters. At
      enrollment, nine (13.4%) of 67 young women with genotyping results had HIV drug
      resistance; resistance was also detected in nine (6.9%) of 131 seroconverters
      with genotyping results. Conclusions:: Most of the HIV-infected young women in
      this cohort from rural South Africa were not taking ARV drugs, suggesting they
      were unaware of their HIV status or were not in care. HIV drug resistance was
      detected in young women with both prevalent and new HIV infection.

TI  - Sustained sexual behavior change following acute HIV diagnosis in Malawi.
PG  - 741-6
AB  - Background: Identification of acute HIV infection (AHI) allows important
      opportunities for HIV prevention through behavior change and biomedical
      intervention. Here, we evaluate changes in sexual risk behaviors among persons
      with AHI enrolled in a combined behavioral and biomedical intervention designed
      to reduce onward transmission of HIV. Methods: Participants were randomized to
      standard HIV counseling, a multi-session behavioral intervention, or a
      multi-session behavioral intervention plus antiretrovirals. Sexual behaviors were
      assessed periodically over one year. Results: Four weeks after diagnosis, the
      predicted probability of reporting multiple sexual partners decreased from 24% to
      9%, and the probability of reporting unprotected sex from 71% to 27%. These
      declines in sexual risk behaviors were sustained over follow-up irrespective of
      study arm. Conclusions: AHI diagnosis alone may be sufficient to achieve
      immediate and sustained behavior change during this highly infectious period.

TI  - Timing of Rotavirus Vaccine Doses and Severe Rotavirus Gastroenteritis among
      Vaccinated Infants in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.
PG  - 867-75
AB  - Background: Altering rotavirus vaccine schedules may improve vaccine performance 
      in low- and middle-income countries. We analyzed data from clinical trials of the
      monovalent (RV1) and pentavalent (RV5) rotavirus vaccines in low- and
      middle-income countries to understand the association between vaccine dose timing
      and severe rotavirus gastroenteritis incidence. Methods: We assessed the
      association between variations in rotavirus vaccine administration schedules and 
      severe rotavirus gastroenteritis risk. We used the complement of the Kaplan–Meier
      survival estimator to estimate risk differences for different schedules. To
      adjust risk differences (RDs) for confounding, we calibrated estimates in the
      vaccinated arm using estimates from the placebo arm. Results: There were 3114 and
      7341 children included from the RV1 and RV5 trials, respectively. The 18-month
      adjusted severe rotavirus gastroenteritis risk was 4.0% (95% confidence interval 
      (CI): 1.1, 7.1) higher for those receiving their first RV5 dose at <6 versus ≥6
      weeks. For RV1, there was a 4.0% (95% CI: 0.0, 8.2) increase in 12-month adjusted
      risk for a 4- versus 6-week interval between doses. Further analysis revealed
      those receiving their first RV5 dose at 3–4 and 5–7 weeks had 2.9% (95% CI: 0.8, 
      5.3) and 1.3% (95% CI: −0.3, 3.0), respectively, higher risk compared to those at
      9–12 weeks. Those receiving their first dose at 8 weeks had the lowest risk [RD: 
      −2.6% (95% CI: −5.4, −0.1)] compared to those at 9–12 weeks. Conclusions: A
      modest delay in rotavirus vaccination start and increase in interval between
      doses may be associated with lower severe rotavirus gastroenteritis risk in low- 
      and middle-income countries.

TI  - Associations between County-level Voter Turnout, County-level Felony Voter
      Disenfranchisement, and Sexually Transmitted Infections among Women in the
      Southern United States.
PG  - 67-73.e1
AB  - Purpose.Voting may play a critical role in the allocation of social and
      structural resources to communities, which in turn shapes neighborhood
      environments, and ultimately, an individual’s sexually transmitted infection
      (STI) risk. We assessed relationships among county-level voter turnout and felony
      voter disenfranchisement, and STIs. Methods.This cross-sectional multilevel
      analysis included 666 women in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and North 
      Carolina enrolled in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study between 2013 and 2015.
      Having a baseline bacterial STI (chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, or early
      syphilis) was determined by laboratory testing. We used generalized estimating
      equations to test relationships between county-level voter turnout in the 2012
      general election, county-level percentage of felony disenfranchised voters, and
      STI prevalence. Results.Eleven percent of participants had a STI. Higher voter
      turnout corresponded to lower STI prevalence (PR=0.84, 95% CI=0.73–0.96 per 4
      percentage point higher turnout). Greater felony voter disenfranchisement
      corresponded to higher STI prevalence (PR =1.89, 95% CI=1.10–3.24 per 4
      percentage point higher disenfranchisement). Conclusion.STI prevalence was
      inversely associated with voter turnout and positively associated with felony
      voter disenfranchisement. Research should assess causality and mechanisms through
      which civic engagement shapes sexual health. Expanding political participation,
      including eliminating discriminatory voting laws, could influence sexual health.

TI  - Meta-Analysis of Genetic Influences on Initial Alcohol Sensitivity.
PG  - 2349-59
AB  - Background:: Previous studies indicate that low initial sensitivity to alcohol
      may be a risk factor for later alcohol misuse. Evidence suggests that initial
      sensitivity is influenced by genetic factors, but few molecular genetic studies
      have been reported. Methods:: We conducted a meta-analysis of two
      population-based genome-wide association studies of the Self-Rating of the
      Effects of Alcohol scale. Our final sample consisted of 7339 individuals (82.3%
      of European descent; 59.2% female) who reported having used alcohol at least 5
      times. In addition, we estimated SNP-based heritability and conducted a series of
      secondary aggregate genetic analyses. Results:: No individual locus reached
      genome-wide significance. Gene- and set-based analyses, both overall and using
      tissue-specific expression data, yielded largely null results, and genes
      previously implicated in alcohol problems and consumption were overall not
      associated with initial sensitivity. Only one gene-set, related to hormone
      signaling and including core clock genes, survived correction for multiple
      testing. A meta-analysis of SNP-based heritability resulted in a modest estimate 
      of h2SNP=0.19 (SE=0.10), though this was driven by one sample (N=3683,
      h2SNP=0.36, SE=0.14, p=0.04). No significant genetic correlations with other
      relevant outcomes were observed. Conclusions:: Findings yielded only modest
      support for a genetic component underlying initial alcohol sensitivity. Results
      suggest that its biological underpinnings may diverge somewhat from that of other
      alcohol outcomes, and may be related to core clock genes or other aspects of
      hormone signaling. Larger samples, ideally of prospectively assessed samples, are
      likely necessary to improve gene identification efforts and confirm the current
      findings.

TI  - Cervical funneling or intra-amniotic debris and preterm birth among nulliparous
      women with a midtrimester cervical length less than 30 mm.
PG  - 757-62
AB  - Objective: To evaluate whether the presence of cervical funneling or
      intra-amniotic debris identified in the second trimester is associated with
      higher rates of preterm birth (PTB) in asymptomatic nulliparous women with a
      midtrimester cervical length (CL) less than 30 mm (i.e., less than the 10th
      percentile). Methods: A secondary cohort analysis of a multicenter trial of women
      between 16 and 22 weeks with a singleton gestation and a CL less than 30 mm by
      transvaginal ultrasound randomized to either 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone
      caproate or placebo. Sonographers were centrally certified in CL measurement, as 
      well as identification of intra-amniotic debris and cervical funneling.
      Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Results: Of the 657
      randomized women, 112 (17%) had only a cervical funnel, 33 (5%) had only
      intra-amniotic debris, and 45 (7%) had both on the second trimester ultrasound.
      Women with either of these findings had a shorter CL (19.5 vs. 25.6 mm, p<0.001) 
      than those without these findings. PTB prior to 37 weeks was more likely for
      women with a funnel (37% vs. 21%; OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5–3.3) or debris (35% vs. 23%,
      OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.9). Results were similar for PTB before 34 and 32 weeks’ of 
      gestation. After multivariable adjustment that included CL, PTB prior to 34 or 32
      weeks continued to be associated with the presence of debris (aOR 1.85, 95% CI
      1.00–3.44; aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.42–5.45, respectively), but not cervical funneling 
      (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 0.63–2.17; aOR 1.45, 95% CI 0.71–2.96, respectively).
      Conclusions: Among asymptomatic nulliparous women with a midtrimester cervical
      length less than 30 mm, the presence of intra-amniotic debris, but not a cervical
      funnel, is associated with increased risk of PTB < 34 weeks of gestation
      independently of the CL.

TI  - Long-Term Effects of Intensive Glycemic and Blood Pressure Control and
      Fenofibrate Use on Kidney Outcomes.
PG  - 1693-702
AB  - Background and objectives: In people with type 2 diabetes, aggressive control of 
      glycemia, BP, and lipids have resulted in conflicting short-term (<5 years)
      kidney outcomes. We aimed to determine the long-term kidney effects of these
      interventions. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: The Action to
      Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) was a multifactorial
      intervention study in people with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular
      disease (n=10,251), to examine the effects of intensive glycemic control
      (hemoglobin A1c <6.0% versus 7%–7.9%), BP control (systolic BP <120 mm Hg versus 
      <140 mm Hg) or fenofibrate versus placebo added to simvastatin on cardiovascular 
      events and death. The glycemia trial lasted 3.7 years and participants were
      followed for another 6.5 years in ACCORDION, the ACCORD Follow-On Study. The post
      hoc primary composite kidney outcome was defined as incident macroalbuminuria,
      creatinine doubling, need for dialysis, or death by any cause. Cox proportional
      hazards regression estimated the effect of each intervention on the composite
      outcome and individual components. In secondary outcome analyses, competing risk 
      regression was used to account for the risk of death in incident kidney outcomes.
      Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographics, randomization groups, and clinical 
      factors. Results: There were 988 cases of incident macroalbuminuria, 954 with
      doubling of creatinine, 351 requiring dialysis, and 1905 deaths. Hazard ratios
      (HRs) for the composite outcome with intensive glycemic, BP control, and
      fenofibrate use compared with standard therapy were 0.92 (95% confidence interval
      [95% CI], 0.86 to 0.98), 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.28), and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06 to
      1.27). Multivariable, secondary outcome analyses showed that in the glycemia
      trial, only macroalbuminuria was significantly decreased (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59 
      to 0.77). In the BP and lipid trials, only creatinine doubling was affected (HR, 
      1.64; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.06 and HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.49, respectively).
      Conclusions: In people with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular
      disease, intensive glycemic control may result in a long-term reduction in
      macroalbuminuria; however, intensive BP control and fenofibrates may increase the
      risk for adverse kidney events.

TI  - DUET: A Phase 2 Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Sparsentan in
      Patients with FSGS.
PG  - 2745-54
AB  - Background: We evaluated and compared the effects of sparsentan, a dual
      endothelin type A (ETA) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, with those
      of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist irbesartan in patients with
      primary FSGS. Methods: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, active-control 
      Efficacy and Safety of Sparsentan (RE-021), a Dual Endothelin Receptor and
      Angiotensin Receptor Blocker, in Patients with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
      (FSGS): A Randomized, Double-blind, Active-Control, Dose-Escalation Study (DUET),
      patients aged 8–75 years with biopsy-proven FSGS, eGFR>30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and
      urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UP/C) ≥1.0 g/g received sparsentan (200,
      400, or 800 mg/d) or irbesartan (300 mg/d) for 8 weeks, followed by open-label
      sparsentan only. End points at week 8 were reduction from baseline in UP/C
      (primary) and proportion of patients achieving FSGS partial remission end point
      (FPRE) (UP/C: ≤1.5 g/g and >40% reduction [secondary]). Results: Of 109 patients 
      randomized, 96 received study drugs and had baseline and week 8 UP/C
      measurements. Sparsentan-treated patients had greater reductions in UP/C than
      irbesartan-treated patients did when all doses (45% versus 19%; P=0.006) or the
      400 and 800 mg doses (47% versus 19%; P=0.01) were pooled for analysis. The FSGS 
      partial remission end point was achieved in 28% of sparsentan-treated and 9% of
      irbesartan-treated patients (P=0.04). After 8 weeks of treatment, BP was reduced 
      with sparsentan but not irbesartan, and eGFR was stable with both treatments.
      Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups. Hypotension 
      and edema were more common among sparsentan-treated patients but did not result
      in study withdrawals. Conclusions: Patients with FSGS achieved significantly
      greater reductions in proteinuria after 8 weeks of sparsentan versus irbesartan. 
      Sparsentan was safe and well tolerated.

TI  - Incidence of Early-Onset Sepsis in Infants Born to Women with Clinical
      Chorioamnionitis.
PG  - 926-33
AB  - Objective:: To determine the frequency of sepsis and other adverse neonatal
      outcomes in women with a clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis. Methods:: We
      performed a secondary analysis of a multi-center placebo-controlled trial of
      vitamins C/E to prevent preeclampsia in low risk nulliparous women. Clinical
      chorioamnionitis was defined as either the "clinical diagnosis” of
      chorioamnionitis or antibiotic administration during labor because of an elevated
      temperature or uterine tenderness in the absence of another cause. Early-onset
      neonatal sepsis was categorized as “suspected” or “confirmed” based on a clinical
      diagnosis with negative or positive blood, urine or cerebral spinal fluid
      cultures, respectively within 72 hours of birth. Adjusted odds ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals were estimated by logistic regression. Results:: Data from
      9391 mother-infant pairs were analyzed. The frequency of chorioamnionitis was
      10.3%. Overall, 6.6% of the neonates were diagnosed with confirmed (0.2%) or
      suspected (6.4%) early-onset sepsis. Only 0.7% of infants born in the setting of 
      chorioamnionitis had culture proven early-onset sepsis versus 0.1% if
      chorioamnionitis was not present. Clinical chorioamnionitis was associated with
      both suspected [OR 4.01 (3.16-5.08)] and confirmed [OR 4.93 (1.65-14.74)]
      early-onset neonatal sepsis, a need for resuscitation within the first 30 minutes
      after birth [OR 2.10 (1.70-2.61)], respiratory distress [OR 3.14 (2.16-4.56)],1
      minute Apgar score of ≤3 [OR 2.69 (2.01-3.60)] and 4-7 [OR 1.71 (1.43-2.04)], and
      5 minute Apgar score of 4-7 [OR 1.67 (1.17-2.37)] (vs. 8-10). Conclusion::
      Clinical chorioamnionitis is common and is associated with neonatal morbidities. 
      However, the vast majority of exposed infants (99.3%) do not have confirmed
      early-onset sepsis.

TI  - Impact of vitamin D depletion during development on mouse sperm DNA methylation.
PG  - 959-74
AB  - Suboptimal environmental conditions during development can substantially alter
      the epigenome. Stable environmentally-induced changes to the germline epigenome, 
      in particular, have important implications for the health of the next generation.
      We showed previously that developmental vitamin D depletion (DVD) resulted in
      loss of DNA methylation at several imprinted loci over two generations. Here, we 
      assessed the impact of DVD on genome-wide methylation in mouse sperm in order to 
      characterize the number, extent and distribution of methylation changes in
      response to DVD and to find genes that may be susceptible to this prevalent
      environmental perturbation. We detected 15,827 loci that were differentially
      methylated in DVD mouse sperm vs. controls. Most epimutations (69%) were loss of 
      methylation, and the extent of methylation change and number of CpGs affected in 
      a region were associated with genic location and baseline methylation state.
      Methylation response to DVD at validated loci was only detected in offspring that
      exhibited a phenotypic response to DVD (increased body and testes weight)
      suggesting the two types of responses are linked, though a causal relationship is
      unclear. Epimutations localized to regions enriched for developmental and
      metabolic genes and pathway analyses showed enrichment for Cadherin, Wnt, PDGF
      and Integrin signaling pathways. These findings show for the first time that
      vitamin D status during development leads to substantial DNA methylation changes 
      across the sperm genome and that locus susceptibility is linked to genomic and
      epigenomic context.

TI  - Infant quantitative risk for autism spectrum disorder predicts executive function
      in early childhood.
PG  - 1532-41
AB  - Much of the current research concerning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) focuses on
      early identification of behaviors that may indicate future deficits or higher
      risk for a later diagnosis. Additionally, there exists a strong claim regarding
      the dimensional nature of ASD, such that even among non-diagnosed individuals, a 
      continuous distribution of symptom severity can be observed. Executive function
      (EF) has been widely studied in children, adolescents, and adults with ASD, with 
      a robust body of research supporting widespread EF deficits in diagnosed
      individuals. However, it remains unclear how the degree of ASD symptomatology,
      outside of the presence of a diagnosis, affects EF abilities in a community
      sample. The First Year Inventory 2.0 (FYI 2.0), a parent-report measure, was
      designed to identify infants at 12 months who are at risk for an eventual ASD
      diagnosis. In the current study, a continuous scoring scale was used to examine
      risk (overall, Social-Communication, and Sensory-Regulatory) from a dimensional
      perspective. Parents also completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
      Function – Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) and the Social Responsiveness Scale – 2nd 
      edition (SRS-2.0) when their children were 42 months (3.5 years) old. Each FYI
      2.0 risk variable significantly predicted scores on an overall EF composite and
      specific EF subscales. When controlling for general ASD symptomatology,
      Sensory-Regulatory risk still significantly predicted EF deficits. This research 
      provides additional support for a quantitative consideration of risk for ASD and 
      presents novel findings regarding the relation between infant behaviors
      indicative of ASD risk and EF in early childhood.

TI  - Triggered Palliative Care for Late-stage Dementia: a Pilot Randomized Trial.
PG  - 10-9
AB  - Context:: Persons with late-stage dementia have limited access to palliative
      care. Objective:: To test dementia-specific specialty palliative care triggered
      by hospitalization. Methods:: This pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled 62 
      dyads of persons with late-stage dementia and family decision-makers on admission
      to hospital. Intervention dyads received dementia-specific specialty palliative
      care consultation plus post-acute transitional care. Control dyads received usual
      care and educational information. The primary outcome was 60-day hospital or
      emergency department visits. Secondary patient and family-centered outcomes were 
      patient comfort, family distress, palliative care domains addressed in the
      treatment plan, and access to hospice or community-based palliative care.
      Secondary decision-making outcomes were discussion of prognosis, goals of care,
      completion of Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), and treatment
      decisions. Results:: Of 137 eligible dyads, 62 (45%) enrolled. The intervention
      proved feasible, with protocol completion ranging from 77% (family 2-week call)
      to 93% (initial consultation). Hospital and emergency department visits did not
      differ (intervention vs control, 0.68 vs 0.53 transfers per 60 days, p=0.415).
      Intervention patients had more palliative care domains addressed, and were more
      likely to receive hospice (25% vs 3%, p<0.019). Intervention families were more
      likely to discuss prognosis (90% vs 3%, p<0.001) and goals of care (90% vs 25%,
      p<0.001), and to have a MOST at 60-day follow-up (79% vs 30%, p<0.001). More
      intervention families made decisions to avoid re-hospitalization (13% vs 0%,
      p=0.033). Conclusion:: Specialty palliative care consultation for hospitalized
      patients with for late-stage dementia is feasible and promising to improve
      decision-making and some treatment outcomes.Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02719938

TI  - Patterns of medication adherence in a multi-ethnic cohort of prevalent statin
      users diagnosed with breast, prostate or colorectal cancer.
PG  - 794-802
AB  - Purpose:: To investigate the implications of a cancer diagnosis on medication
      adherence for pre-existing comorbid conditions, we explored statin adherence
      patterns prior to and following a new diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate
      cancer among a multi-ethnic cohort. Methods:: We identified adults enrolled at
      Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were prevalent statin medication users,
      newly diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer between 2000–2012.
      Statin adherence was measured using the proportion of days covered (PDC) during
      the two years pre-cancer diagnosis and the two years post-cancer diagnosis.
      Adherence patterns were assessed using generalized estimating equations, for all 
      cancers combined and stratified by cancer type and race/ethnicity, adjusted for
      demographic, clinical, and tumor characteristics. Results:: Among 10,177 cancer
      patients, statin adherence decreased from pre- to postcancer diagnosis (Adjusted 
      Odds Ratio (ORadj):0.91, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI):0.88–0.94). Statin
      adherence decreased from pre- to post-cancer diagnosis among breast (ORadj:0.94, 
      95% CI:0.90–0.99) and colorectal (ORadj:0.79, 95% CI:0.74–0.85) cancer patients. 
      No difference in adherence was observed among prostate cancer patients
      (ORadj:1.01, 95% CI:0.97–1.05). Prior to cancer diagnosis, adherence to statins
      was generally higher among non-Hispanic whites and multi-race patients than other
      groups. However, statin adherence after diagnosis decreased only among these two 
      populations (ORadj:0.85, 95% CI:0.85–0.92 and ORadj:0.86, 95% CI:0.76–0.97),
      respectively. Conclusions:: We found substantial variation in statin medication
      adherence following diagnosis by cancer type and race/ethnicity among a large
      cohort of prevalent statin users in an integrated health care setting.
      Implications for Cancer Survivors:: Improving our understanding of comorbidity
      management and polypharmacy across diverse cancer patient populations is
      warranted to develop tailored interventions that improve medication adherence and
      reduce disparities in health outcomes.

TI  - Adult physical activity and breast cancer risk in women with a family history of 
      breast cancer.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - Background:: Recreational physical activity has been consistently associated with
      reduced breast cancer risk. Less is known about how family history of breast
      cancer impacts the association, and whether it varies by menopausal status.
      Methods:: The Sister Study is a cohort of 50,884 women who had a sister with
      breast cancer, but no prior breast cancer themselves. Women reported all
      recreational sport/exercise activities they participated in over the past 12
      months. Hours/week and MET-hours/week of physical activity were considered in
      association with breast cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox regression. Extent of family history,
      examined as a modifier, was characterized by a Bayesian score incorporating
      characteristics of the family structure. Results:: During follow-up (average 8.4 
      years), 3,023 cases were diagnosed. Higher hours/week (HR≥7vs<1=0.77; 95%CI:
      0.66–0.90) and MET-hours/week (HRquartile4vs1=0.75; 95%CI: 0.67–0.85) of physical
      activity were associated with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
      Hours/week and MET-hours/week were associated with suggestive increased
      premenopausal breast cancer risk (MET-hours/week HRquartile4vs1=1.25; 95%CI:
      0.98–1.60). Associations did not vary with extent of family history. However, the
      increased risk in premenopausal women may be limited to those with stronger
      family history. Conclusions:: In women with a family history of breast cancer,
      physical activity was associated with reduced postmenopausal, but not
      premenopausal, breast cancer risk and was not modified by extent of family
      history. Impact:: This was the first study to examine the association between
      physical activity and breast cancer risk in a large population with a family
      history of breast cancer.

TI  - Body fatness, adipose tissue compartments and biomarkers of inflammation and
      angiogenesis in colorectal cancer: the ColoCare Study.
PG  - 76-82
AB  - Background:: Adiposity has been linked to both risk and prognosis of colorectal
      cancer; however, the impact of different fat areas [visceral (VFA) vs.
      subcutaneous fat area (SFA)] is unclear. We investigated associations between
      adiposity and biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis among patients with
      colorectal cancer. Methods:: Preoperative serum samples and computed tomography
      scans were obtained from 188 patients diagnosed with primary invasive stage I-IV 
      colorectal cancer enrolled in the ColoCare Study. Adiposity was assessed by
      area-based quantification of VFA, SFA, and VFA:SFA ratio on spinal levels L3/L4
      and L4/L5. Circulating levels of inflammation (CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1) and
      angiogenesis (VEGF-A, VEGF-D) were assessed from patient sera on the
      Meso-Scale-Discoveries platform. Partial correlations and regression analyses,
      adjusted for age, sex, and tumor stage, were performed. Results:: VFA was
      moderately correlated with CRP and SAA (CRP: L3/L4 and L4/L5:r=0.21, p=0.01; SAA:
      L3/L4:r=0.17, p=0.04). The correlation between SFA and the measured biomarkers
      were weak (r≤0.13, not significant). The ratio of VFA:SFA at L3/L4 was moderately
      correlated with VEGF-A (r=0.28, p=0.0008), and SAA (r=0.24, p=0.006), and less so
      with CRP (r=0.18, p=0.04) and sICAM-1 (r=0.18, p=0.04). Similar correlations were
      found for VFA:SFA ratio at L4/L5. Conclusions:: We observed an association
      between visceral adiposity and biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis in
      colorectal cancer patients. In particular, the VFA:SFA ratio was correlated with 
      circulating levels of pro-angiogenic biomarker VEGF-A. Impact:: Our findings
      support a direct association of visceral adipose tissue with inflammatory and
      angiogenic processes, which play fundamental roles in the development and
      progression of colorectal cancer.

      performed that evaluated the relationship between serum hormone concentrations,
      MPS function, and PK disposition of PLD in refractory ovarian cancer patients.
      Results:: Univariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between serum
      estradiol and body mass index (OR: 8.64, 95% CI: 2.67–28.0, p<0.001). Estrone and
      testosterone concentrations were positively correlated with MPS function
      (rho=0.57 and 0.53, p=0.14 and 0.18, respectively) and inversely correlated with 
      PLD PK exposure (rho= −0.75 and −0.76, respectively, p=0.02 for both).
      Conclusions:: Higher MPS function resulting in reduced PLD exposure is a
      potential mechanism for reduced efficacy of PLD and other nanoparticles observed 
      in obese patients with cancer. PK simulations suggest higher doses of PLD are
      required in obese patients to achieve similar exposures as standard dosing in
      normal weight patients.

TI  - Effect of Dual Use of Veterans Affairs and Medicare Part D Drug Benefits on
      Antihypertensive Medication Supply in a National Cohort of Veterans with
      Dementia.
PG  - 5375-401
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of dual use of VA/Medicare Part D drug benefits
      on antihypertensive medication supply in older Veterans with dementia. Data
      Sources/Study Setting: National, linked 2007–2010 Veterans Affairs (VA) and
      Medicare utilization and prescription records for 50,763 dementia patients with
      hypertension. Study Design: We used inverse probability of treatment
      (IPT)‐weighted multinomial logistic regression to examine the association of dual
      prescription use with undersupply and oversupply of antihypertensives. Data
      Collection/Extraction Methods: Veterans Affairs and Part D prescription records
      were used to classify patients as VA‐only, Part D‐only, or dual VA/Part D users
      of antihypertensives and summarize their antihypertensive medication supply in
      2010: (1) appropriate supply of all prescribed antihypertensive classes, (2)
      undersupply of ≥1 class with no oversupply of another class, (3) oversupply of ≥1
      class with no undersupply, or (4) both undersupply and oversupply. Principal
      Findings: Dual prescription users were more likely than VA‐only users to have
      undersupply only (aOR = 1.28; 95 percent CI = 1.18–1.39), oversupply only
      (aOR = 2.38; 95 percent CI = 2.15–2.64), and concurrent under‐ and oversupply
      (aOR = 2.89; 95 percent CI = 2.53–3.29), versus appropriate supply of all
      classes. Conclusions: Obtaining antihypertensives through both VA and Part D was 
      associated with increased antihypertensive under‐ and oversupply. Efforts to
      understand how best to coordinate dual‐system prescription use are critically
      needed.

TI  - Risk of stillbirth among Zambian women with a prior cesarean delivery.
PG  - 360-6
AB  - Objective:: Cesarean delivery (CD) may be associated with stillbirth in future
      pregnancies. We investigated prior CD as a risk factor for stillbirth in Lusaka, 
      Zambia. Methods:: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of women with only
      one prior pregnancy who delivered between February 1, 2006, and May 31, 2013. We 
      analysed data from the Zambia Electronic Perinatal System. Maternal and infant
      characteristics were analyzed for association with stillbirth using Pearson’s χ2 
      test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We calculated risk of stillbirth (antepartum 
      vs intrapartum) by prior CD, with a log Poisson model to adjust for confounding. 
      Results:: Of 57,320 women in our cohort, 1933 (3.4%) reported a prior CD. There
      were 1012 (1.8%) stillbirths in the no prior CD group and 81 (4.2%) in the prior 
      CD group (P<0.001). In multivariate models adjusting for stillbirth risk factors,
      prior CD was associated with antepartum (adjusted risk ratio 1.56, 95% confidence
      interval 1.08–2.24) and intrapartum (3.26, 2.40–4.42) stillbirth compared with no
      prior CD. The difference between groups was most apparent at 36–37 weeks’
      gestation (log-rank P<0.001). Conclusion:: Prior CD was associated with increased
      risk of stillbirth. Improved monitoring during labor and safe methods for
      induction are urgently needed in low-resource settings.

TI  - Association between Deepwater Horizon oil spill response and cleanup work
      experiences and lung function.
PG  - 695-702
AB  - Introduction:: Oil spill response and cleanup (OSRC) workers had potentially
      stressful experiences during mitigation efforts following the 2010 Deepwater
      Horizon disaster. Smelling chemicals; skin or clothing contact with oil; heat
      stress; handling oily plants/wildlife or dead animal recovery; and/or being out
      of regular work may have posed a risk to worker respiratory health through
      psychological stress mechanisms. Objective:: To evaluate the association between 
      six potentially stressful oil spill experiences and lung function among OSRC
      workers 1-3 years following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, while controlling for
      primary oil spill inhalation hazards and other potential confounders. Methods::
      Of 6,811 GuLF STUDY participants who performed OSRC work and completed a quality 
      spirometry test, 4,806 provided information on all exposures and confounders. We 
      carried out complete case analysis and used multiple imputation to assess risk
      among the larger sample. Potentially stressful work experiences were identified
      from an earlier study of these workers. The lung function parameters of interest 
      include the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1, mL), the forced vital
      capacity (FVC, mL) and the ratio (FEV1/FVC, %). Results:: On average,
      participants in the analytic sample completed spirometry tests 1.7 years after
      the spill. Among workers with at least 2 acceptable FEV1 and FVC curves, workers 
      with jobs that involved oily plants/wildlife or dead animal recovery had lower
      values of FEV1 (Mean difference: −53 mL, 95% CI: −84, −22), FVC (Mean difference:
      −45 mL, 95% CI: −81, −9) and FEV1/FVC (Mean difference: −0.44%, 95% CI: −0.80,
      −0.07) compared to unexposed workers in analyses using multiple imputation.
      Conclusions:: Workers involved in handling oily plants/wildlife or dead animal
      recovery had lower lung function than unexposed workers after accounting for
      other OSRC inhalation hazards.

TI  - Burden and Cost of Gastrointestinal, Liver, and Pancreatic Diseases in the United
      States: Update 2018.
PG  - 254-272.e11
AB  - Background & Aims:: Estimates of disease burden can inform national health
      priorities for research, clinical care, and policy. We aimed to estimate health
      care use and spending among gastrointestinal (GI) (including luminal, liver, and 
      pancreatic) diseases in the United States. Methods:: We estimated health care use
      and spending based on the most currently available administrative claims from
      commercial and Medicare Supplemental plans, data from the GI Quality Improvement 
      Consortium Registry, and national databases. Results:: In 2015, annual health
      care expenditures for gastrointestinal diseases totaled $135.9 billion. Hepatitis
      ($23.3 billion), esophageal disorders ($18.1 billion), biliary tract disease
      ($10.3 billion), abdominal pain ($10.2 billion), and inflammatory bowel disease
      ($7.2 billion) were the most expensive. Yearly, there were more than 54.4 million
      ambulatory visits with a primary diagnosis for a GI disease, 3.0 million hospital
      admissions, and 540,500 all-cause 30-day readmissions. There were 266,600 new
      cases of GI cancers diagnosed and 144,300 cancer deaths. Each year, there were
      97,700 deaths from non-malignant GI diseases. An estimated 11.0 million
      colonoscopies, 6.1 million upper endoscopies, 313,000 flexible sigmoidoscopies,
      178,400 upper endoscopic ultrasound examinations, and 169,500 endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures were performed annually. Among
      average-risk persons ages 50–75 years who underwent colonoscopy, 34.6% had 1 or
      more adenomatous polyps, 4.7% had 1 or more advanced adenomatous polyps, and 5.7%
      had 1 or more serrated polyps removed. Conclusions:: GI diseases contribute
      substantially to health care use in the United States. Total expenditures for GI 
      diseases are $135.9 billion dollars annually—greater than for other common
      diseases. Expenditures are likely to continue increasing.

TI  - High School Athletic Trainer Services for Knee Injuries.
PG  - 956-64
AB  - Context: Participation in high school athletics carries a substantial risk of
      musculoskeletal injury, particularly to the knee. However, limited information is
      available on the care being provided by athletic trainers (ATs) for athletes with
      these injuries. Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Data on athletic
      training facility visits and AT services were collected from 147 high schools in 
      26 states. Patients or Other Participants: High school student-athletes who
      participated in 13 boys' sports and 14 girls' sports and sustained a diagnosed
      knee injury during the 2011–2012 through 2013–2014 academic years. The ATs
      documented 6797 knee injuries, with 4242 sustained in boys' sports and 2555
      sustained in girls' sports. Main Outcome Measure(s): The number of athletic
      training facility visits and individual AT services as well as the average,
      median, and interquartile range of athletic training facility visits (per injury)
      and AT services (per injury) were calculated by sport and for time-loss (TL;
      participation restricted for ≥24 hours) and non–time-loss (NTL; participation
      restricted for <24 hours) injuries. Results: In total, 28 788 athletic training
      facility visits were reported, with an overall average of 4 athletic training
      facility visits per knee injury over the 3-year period. Most athletic training
      facility visits (72.6%) were associated with NTL injuries, but the majority of AT
      services (68.6%) were associated with TL injuries. A total of 81 245 AT services 
      were provided for all knee injuries. Therapeutic activities or exercise were the 
      most common type of AT service (52.5%). Overall, an average of 12 AT services
      were reported per knee injury. Compared with NTL injuries, TL injuries had a
      larger average number of AT services per injury (34 versus 9; P < .001).
      Conclusions: Knee injuries at the high school level are a considerable health
      care burden. This report demonstrates a high proportion of AT attention to the
      evaluation and treatment of these injuries. This study confirms the recommended
      management of knee injuries, with neuromuscular and therapeutic activities being 
      the primary services after knee injury.

TI  - Concordance between Goals of Care and Treatment Decisions for Persons with
      Dementia.
PG  - 1442-7
AB  - Background: Nursing home (NH) residents with dementia experience high rates of
      intensive treatment near the end of life. Limited research examines whether
      treatment is concordant with goals of care (GOC).Objectives: We analyzed data
      from the GOC trial to describe family decision makers' preferred GOC and
      perceptions of goal-concordant care for NH residents with late-stage dementia We 
      compared subsequent treatment orders when families chose a primary goal of
      comfort versus other goals.Design: We performed a secondary analysis of data from
      baseline and 9-month family decision-maker interviews and chart reviews.Setting
      and Participants: A total of 302 dyads of NH residents and family decision makers
      in 22 North Carolina NHs were enrolled.Measurements: In baseline and follow-up
      interviews, families reported on their and NH staff's primary GOC, and perceived 
      prognosis and goal-concordant care. Chart reviews provided data on treatment
      orders, hospital transfers, and hospice, which were compared after selection of a
      primary goal of comfort versus other goals.Results: Family chose comfort as the
      primary goal for 66% of residents at baseline, and for nearly 80% by 9 months or 
      death. At baseline, 49% perceived concordance with NH staff on the primary goal, 
      and 69% at follow-up. In multivariate models, choice of comfort as the primary
      goal, versus other goals, was associated with half as many hospital transfers
      (0.11 vs. 0.25/90 person-days, confidence interval [−0.2 to −0.01]), but not with
      hospice or treatment orders.Conclusions: Most families chose comfort as the
      primary GOC. Further research is needed to translate this preference into
      comfort-focused treatment plans for late-stage dementia.Clinicaltrials.gov:
      NCT01565642 (3/26/12).

TI  - Sleep Timing, Stability, and BP in the Sueño Ancillary Study of the Hispanic
      Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.
PG  - 60-8
AB  - Background: Timing and stability of the sleep-wake cycle are potential modifiable
      risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the relationship between objective measures of sleep-wake timing and stability
      with cardiometabolic disease risk. Methods: In this multicenter, cross-sectional,
      population-based study, actigraphy data were obtained from the 2,156 adults, aged
      18 to 64 years, recruited from the Sueño ancillary study of the Hispanic
      Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (2010-2013). These data were correlated
      with measures of cardiometabolic disease risk, including systolic and diastolic
      BPs, homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance, glycosylated hemoglobin, BMI, 
      and hypertension and diabetes status. Results: Each 10% decrease in interdaily
      stability was associated with a 3.0% absolute increase in the prevalence of
      hypertension (95% CI, 0.6-5.3; P < .05), an increase in systolic BP by 0.78 mm Hg
      (95% CI, 0.12-1.45; P < .05) and an increase in diastolic BP by 0.80 mm Hg
      (95% CI, 0.28-1.32; P < .05). In addition, delaying the midpoint of sleep by 1 h 
      was associated with an increase in systolic BP by 0.73 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.30-1.16; 
      P < .01) and diastolic BP by 0.53 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.17-0.90; P < .01). These
      associations were not significant after adjusting for shift work status. No
      association was found between interdaily stability or sleep timing and diabetes, 
      BMI, or insulin resistance. Conclusions: These results suggest that beyond sleep 
      duration, the timing and regularity of sleep-wake schedules are related to
      hypertension prevalence and BP.

TI  - What Do Transplant Physicians Think about Palliative Care? A National Survey
      Study.
PG  - 4556-66
AB  - Background: Despite its established benefits, palliative care (PC) is rarely
      utilized for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. We sought to
      examine transplant physicians’ perceptions of PC. Methods: We conducted a
      cross-sectional survey of transplant physicians recruited from the
      American-Society-for-Blood-and-Marrow-Transplantation. Using a 28-item
      questionnaire adapted from prior studies, we examined physicians’ access to PC
      services, and perceptions of PC. We computed a composite score of physicians’
      attitudes about PC (mean=16.9, SD=3.37) and explored predictors of attitudes
      using a linear mixed model. Results: 277/1005 (28%) of eligible physicians
      completed the questionnaire. The majority (76%) stated that they trust PC
      clinicians to care for their patients, but 40% felt that PC clinicians do not
      have enough understanding to counsel HSCT patients about their treatments. Most
      endorsed that when patients hear the term PC, they feel scared (82%) and anxious 
      (75%). Nearly half (45%) reported that the service name ‘palliative care’ is a
      barrier to utilization. Female sex (β=0.85, P=0.024), having <10 years of
      clinical practice (β=1.39, P=0.004), and perceived quality of PC services
      (β=0.60, P<0.001) were all associated with a more positive attitude towards PC.
      Physicians with a higher sense of ownership over their patients’ PC issues
      (β=−0.36, P <0.001) were more likely to have a negative attitude towards PC.
      Conclusions: The majority of transplant physicians trust PC, but have substantial
      concerns about PC clinicians’ knowledge about HSCT and patients’ perception of
      the term ‘palliative care’. Interventions are needed to promote collaboration,
      improve perceptions, and enhance integration of PC for HSCT recipients.

TI  - The early natural history of albuminuria in young adults with youth-onset type 1 
      and type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1160-8
AB  - AIMS:: To determine among adolescents and young adults with youth-onset type 1
      diabetes and type 2 diabetes the rates and risk factors for albuminuria
      regression and progression. The research hypothesis was that youth with type 2
      diabetes would be more likely to show progression of albuminuria. METHODS:: Data 
      from SEARCH, a longitudinal observational study of youth-onset type 1 diabetes
      (N=1316) and type 2 diabetes (N=143) were analyzed. Urine albumin:creatinine
      ratio (UACR) was measured from random urine specimens at baseline and follow-up
      visits (mean 7 years later). Albuminuria regression was defined as halving of
      baseline UACR when baseline UACR was ≥30μg/mg; progression was defined as
      doubling of baseline UACR when follow-up UACR was ≥30μg/mg, respectively.
      Multivariable regression assessed risk factors associated with low-risk
      albuminuria category (combined persistently-low albuminuria and regression)
      versus moderate-risk albuminuria category (combined persistently-high albuminuria
      and progression). RESULTS:: Albuminuria progression was more common in type 2
      diabetes versus type 1 diabetes (15.4% versus 6.0%, p<0.001). Moderate-risk
      albuminuria was associated with increasing HbA1c (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.3, 95% CI
      1.1–1.6) and lack of private health insurance (aOR=2.7, 95%CI 1.1–6.5) in type 1 
      diabetes; and African American race (OR=4.6, 95% CI 1.2–14.2), lower estimated
      insulin sensitivity score (aOR=2.1, 95% CI 1.4–3.3), baseline UACR (aOR=3.2, 95% 
      CI 1.7–5.8), and follow-up estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (10-unit
      increase aOR=1.3, 95% CI 1.0, 1.5) in type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS:: In the first
      decade of diabetes duration, kidney complications in type 2 diabetes are
      significantly more aggressive than in type 1 diabetes and may be associated with 
      less modifiable risk factors including race, insulin sensitivity, and eGFR.
      Interventions are needed even at very early stages of disease to reduce the
      long-term consequences of diabetic kidney disease in youth-onset diabetes.

TI  - An Experimental Murine Model to Study Periodontitis.
PG  - 2247-67
AB  - Periodontal disease (PD) is a common dental disease associated with the
      interaction between a dysbiotic oral microbiota and host immunity. It is a
      prevalent disease resulting in loss of gingival tissue, periodontal ligament,
      cementum, and alveolar bone. PD is a major form of tooth loss in the adult
      population. Experimental animal models have enabled the study of PD pathogenesis 
      and are used to test new therapeutic approaches for treating disease. The
      ligature-induced periodontitis model has several advantages compared to other
      models, including rapid disease induction, predictable bone loss, and the
      capacity to study periodontal tissue and alveolar bone regeneration due to the
      model being established within the periodontal apparatus. Although mice are the
      most convenient and versatile animal models used in research, ligature-induced
      periodontitis has been more frequently used in large animals. This is mostly due 
      to the technical challenges required to consistently place ligatures around
      murine teeth. To reduce the technical challenge associated with the traditional
      ligature model, we previously developed a simplified method to easily install the
      bacterial retentive ligature between 2 molars for inducing periodontitis. In this
      protocol we provide detailed instructions for placement of the ligature and
      demonstrate how the model can be used to evaluate gingival tissue inflammation
      and alveolar bone loss over an 18 day period following ligature placement. This
      model can also be used on germ free mice to investigate the role of human oral
      bacteria in periodontitis in vivo. In conclusion, this protocol enables the
      mechanistic study of the pathogenesis of periodontitis in vivo.

TI  - Environmental styrene exposure and neurologic symptoms in U.S. Gulf coast
      residents.
PG  - 480-90
AB  - Background:: Styrene is an established neurotoxicant at occupational levels, but 
      effects at levels relevant to the general population have not been studied. We
      examined the neurologic effects of environmental styrene exposure among U.S. Gulf
      coast residents. Methods:: We used National Air Toxics Assessment 2011 estimates 
      of ambient styrene concentrations to assign exposure levels for 21,962
      non-diabetic Gulf state residents, and additionally measured blood styrene
      concentration in a subset of participants (n=874). Neurologic symptoms, as well
      as detailed covariate information, were ascertained via telephone interview. We
      used log-binomial regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (95% CI) for cross-sectional associations between both
      ambient and blood styrene levels and self-reported neurologic symptoms. We
      estimated associations independently for ten unique symptoms, as well as for the 
      presence of any neurologic, central nervous system (CNS), or peripheral nervous
      system (PNS) symptoms. We also examined heterogeneity of associations with
      estimated ambient styrene levels by race and sex. Results:: One-third of
      participants reported at least one neurologic symptom. The highest quartile of
      estimated ambient styrene was associated with one or more neurologic (PR, 1.12;
      95% CI: 1.07,1.18), CNS (PR, 1.17; 95% CI: 1.11,1.25), and PNS (PR, 1.16; 95% CI:
      1.09,1.25) symptom. Results were less consistent for biomarker analyses, but
      blood styrene level was suggestively associated with nausea (PR, 1.78; 95% CI:
      1.04, 3.03). In stratified analyses, we observed the strongest effects among
      non-White participants. Conclusions:: Increasing estimated ambient styrene
      concentration was consistently associated with increased prevalence of neurologic
      symptoms. Associations between blood styrene levels and some neurologic symptoms 
      were suggestive. Environmental styrene exposure levels may be sufficient to
      elicit symptomatic neurotoxic effects.

      study quality using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence grading
      system. We calculated pooled absolute rates of IUD expulsion and estimated
      adjusted relative risks (RRs) for timing of postpartum placement, delivery
      method, and IUD type using log-binomial multivariable regression model.
      TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS:: We identified 48 level I to II-3 studies
      of poor to good quality. Pooled rates of expulsion varied by timing of IUD
      placement, ranging from 1.9% with interval placements (4 weeks postpartum or
      greater), 10.0% for immediate placements (10 minutes or less after placental
      delivery), and 29.7% for early placements (greater than 10 minutes to less than 4
      weeks postpartum). Immediate and early postpartum placements were associated with
      increased risk of expulsion compared with interval placement (adjusted RR 7.63,
      95% CI 4.31–13.51; adjusted RR 6.17, 95% CI 3.19–11.93, respectively). Postpartum
      placement less than 4 weeks after vaginal delivery was associated with an
      increased risk of expulsion compared with cesarean delivery (adjusted RR 5.19,
      95% CI 3.85–6.99). Analysis of expulsion rates at less than 4 weeks postpartum
      also indicated that the levonorgestrel intrauterine system was associated with a 
      higher risk of expulsion (adjusted RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.50–2.43) compared with
      CuT380A. CONCLUSION:: Postpartum IUD expulsion rates vary by timing of placement,
      delivery method, and IUD type. These results can aid in counseling women to make 
      an informed choice about when to initiate their IUD and to help institutions
      implement postpartum contraception programs.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus, high-risk human papillomavirus and abnormal cervical cytology
      in a prospective cohort of African female sex workers.
PG  - 666-72
AB  - Background: High oncogenic-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is necessary,
      although insufficient, to promote cervical cancer. Like HPV, Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV) is a common pathogen with the capacity to promote epithelial neoplasms. We 
      examined the association between cervical EBV, hrHPV, and cytology in female sex 
      workers in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: Women (n=332) with known cervical cytology
      and hrHPV mRNA results were evaluated for cervical EBV DNA by conventional PCR.
      Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to assess the relationships between EBV,
      hrHPV and cervical cytology. Prospective analyses utilized risk ratios (RR) and
      time-to-event analyses to determine the association of EBV with hrHPV clearance
      and abnormal cytology outcomes. Results: Baseline prevalence of hrHPV and EBV was
      29% and 19%, respectively. Higher EBV prevalence was found among women with older
      age, HIV, hrHPV, abnormal cytology, Mycoplasma genitalium infection, smoking
      habits, younger age at sexual debut and less frequent condom use. At baseline,
      women with EBV had a higher prevalence of hrHPV infection than EBV-negative women
      (52% versus 24%; HIV-adjusted PR [95% CI]: 1.8 [1.3, 2.6]). EBV-positive women
      had a higher prevalence than EBV-negative women of high-grade precancer (15%
      versus 2%), and abnormal cytology (37% versus 15%), although HIV- and
      hrHPV-adjusted associations were not significant (high-grade precancer - PR: 2.0 
      [0.7, 5.9]; abnormal cytology - PR: 1.4 [0.9, 2.2]). In prospective analyses, a
      marginal association was observed between baseline EBV detection and delayed
      hrHPV clearance. Conclusions: Our data support a possible role for EBV as a
      high-risk marker or co-factor for HPV-mediated cervical cancer development.

TI  - Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms Among a Population of HIV-Infected Men and
      Women in Routine HIV Care in the United States.
PG  - 3176-87
AB  - Depressive symptoms vary in severity and chronicity. We used group-based
      trajectory models to describe trajectories of depressive symptoms (measured using
      the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and predictors of trajectory group membership
      among 1493 HIV-infected men (84%) and 292 HIV-infected women (16%). At baseline, 
      29% of women and 26% of men had depressive symptoms. Over a median of 30 months
      of follow-up, we identified four depressive symptom trajectories for women
      (labeled “low” [experienced by 56% of women], “mild/moderate” [24%], “improving” 
      [14%], and “severe” [6%]) and five for men (“low” [61%], “mild/moderate” [14%],
      “rebounding” [5%], “improving” [13%], and “severe” [7%]). Baseline antidepressant
      prescription, panic symptoms, and prior mental health diagnoses were associated
      with more severe or dynamic depressive symptom trajectories. Nearly a quarter of 
      participants experienced some depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for
      improved depression management. Addressing more severe or dynamic depressive
      symptom trajectories may require interventions that additionally address mental
      health comorbidities.

TI  - The First Decade of Web-Based Sports Injury Surveillance: Descriptive
      Epidemiology of Injuries in US High School Girls' Volleyball (2005–2006 Through
      2013–2014) and National Collegiate Athletic Association Women's Volleyball
      (2004–2005 Through 2013–2014).
PG  - 926-37
AB  - Context: : The advent of Web-based sports injury surveillance via programs such
      as the High School Reporting Information Online system and the National
      Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program has aided in the
      acquisition of girls' and women's volleyball injury data. Objective: : To
      describe the epidemiology of injuries sustained in high school girls' volleyball 
      in the 2005–2006 through 2013–2014 academic years and collegiate women's
      volleyball in the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 academic years using Web-based
      sports injury surveillance. Design: : Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: : 
      Online injury surveillance from high school girls' (annual average = 100) and
      collegiate women's (annual average = 50) volleyball teams. Patients or Other
      Participants: : Girls' and women's volleyball players who participated in
      practices and competitions during the 2005–2006 through 2013–2014 academic years 
      in high school and the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 academic years in college.
      Main Outcome Measure(s): : Athletic trainers collected time-loss (≥24 hours)
      injury and exposure data. Injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), injury
      rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and injury proportions by
      body site and diagnosis were calculated. Results: : The High School Reporting
      Information Online system documented 1634 time-loss injuries during 1 471 872
      AEs; the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program
      documented 2149 time-loss injuries during 563 845 AEs. The injury rate was higher
      in college than in high school (3.81/1000 versus 1.11/1000 AEs; IRR = 3.43; 95%
      CI = 3.22, 3.66), and higher in high schools with ≤1000 students than in those
      with >1000 students (IRR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.23, 1.49). Injury rates did not vary 
      by collegiate division. The injury rate was higher during competitions than
      practices for high school (IRR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.36) but not for college
      (IRR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.92, 1.10). Ankle sprains were common in both the high
      school and collegiate setting. However, liberos had a high incidence of
      concussion. Conclusions: : Injury rates were higher among collegiate than high
      school players. However, injury rates differed by event type in high school,
      unlike college. Concussion injury patterns among liberos varied from those for
      other positions. These findings highlight the need for injury-prevention
      interventions specific to setting and position.

TI  - Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate Tracing Among Small-for-Gestational Age Compared
      With Appropriate-for-Gestational-Age Neonates.
PG  - 1019-25
AB  - Objective:: To compare fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns during the last hour of
      labor between small- (SGA; birthweight <10th percentile for GA) and
      appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA; birthweight at 10–90th percentile) neonates
      at ≥36 weeks of gestation. We also compared the rate of cesarean delivery and
      composite neonatal morbidity among SGA and AGA newborns. Methods:: This is a
      secondary analysis of a randomized trial of intrapartum fetal ECG ST-segment
      analysis. We excluded women with chorioamnionitis, insufficient duration of FHR
      tracing in the hour before delivery, and anomalous newborns. Fetal heart rate
      patterns were categorized by computerized pattern recognition software (PeriCALM 
      Patterns). Composite neonatal morbidity was defined as any of the following:
      intrapartum fetal death, Apgar score ≤3 at 5 minutes, cord artery pH ≤7.05 and
      base deficit ≥12 mmol/L, neonatal seizure, intubation at delivery, neonatal
      encephalopathy, neonatal death. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the
      association between FHR patterns and SGA adjusted for magnesium sulfate exposure 
      and stage of labor. Results:: Of the 11,108 women randomized, 85% (n=9,402) met
      inclusion criteria, of whom 9% were SGA. In the last hour, the likelihood of
      accelerations was significantly lower among SGA than AGA neonates (72.4% vs.
      66.8%; P=0.001). Variable decelerations lasting >60 seconds, with depth >60 bpm
      or nadir <60 bpm were significantly more common with SGA than AGA (all P<0.001). 
      The rate of late decelerations, prolonged decelerations, or bradycardia were
      similar between SGA and AGA (all P>0.05). Cesarean delivery for fetal indications
      was significantly more common with SGA (7.0%) than AGA (4.0%; P<0.001). The
      composite neonatal morbidity was 1.4% among SGA and 1.0% among AGA (OR 1.40; 95% 
      CI 0.74, 2.64). Conclusions:: Although the FHR patterns in the last hour of labor
      differ among SGA and AGA infants, as does the rate of cesarean delivery, the
      composite neonatal morbidity was similar.

TI  - Cigarette Smoking and All-Cause and Cause-Specific Adult Mortality in the United 
      States.
PG  - 1855-85
AB  - This study illuminates the association between cigarette smoking and adult
      mortality in the contemporary United States. Recent studies have estimated
      smoking-attributable mortality using indirect approaches or with sample data that
      are not nationally representative and that lack key confounders. We use the
      1990–2011 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality Files to estimate
      relative risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for current and former
      smokers compared with never smokers. We examine causes of death established as
      attributable to smoking as well as additional causes that appear to be linked to 
      smoking but have not yet been declared by the U.S. Surgeon General to be caused
      by smoking. Mortality risk is substantially elevated among smokers for
      established causes and moderately elevated for additional causes. We also
      decompose the mortality disadvantage among smokers by cause of death and estimate
      the number of smoking-attributable deaths for the U.S. adult population ages 35+,
      net of sociodemographic and behavioral confounders. The elevated risks translate 
      to 481,887 excess deaths per year among current and former smokers compared with 
      never smokers, 14 % to 15 % of which are due to the additional causes. The
      additional causes of death contribute to the health burden of smoking and should 
      be considered in future studies of smoking-attributable mortality. This study
      demonstrates that smoking-attributable mortality must remain a top population
      health priority in the United States and makes several contributions to further
      illuminate the human costs of this tragedy that has ravaged American society for 
      more than a century.

TI  - Relationship between advanced maternal age and timing of first developmental
      evaluation in children with autism.
PG  - 601-9
AB  - Objective: Mothers of advanced maternal age at childbirth (AMA, age ≥35) may have
      different perceptions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk, independent of
      sociodemographic factors, which may affect ASD identification. We aimed to
      estimate associations between AMA and both age of a child’s first evaluation
      noting developmental concerns and time from first evaluation to first ASD
      diagnosis. Methods: We used data for eight-year-olds identified with ASD in the
      2008–2012 Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. We estimated 
      differences in age at first evaluation noting developmental concerns and time to 
      first ASD diagnosis by AMA using quantile and Cox regression. Results: Of 10,358 
      children with ASD, 19.7% had mothers of AMA. AMA was associated with higher
      educational attainment and prior live births compared to younger mothers. In
      unadjusted analyses, AMA was associated with earlier first evaluation noting
      developmental concerns (median 37 vs. 40 months) and patterns in time to first
      evaluation (Hazard ratio: 1.12, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.06, 1.18).
      Associations between AMA and evaluation timing diminished and were no longer
      significant after adjustment for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.
      Child intellectual disability did not modify associations between AMA and timing 
      of evaluations. Conclusion: AMA is one sociodemographic factor associated with
      younger age of first evaluation noting developmental concerns in children with
      ASD, but AMA was not independently associated likely since it is a consequence or
      co-factor of maternal education and other sociodemographic characteristics. AMA
      may be a demographic factor to consider when aiming to screen and evaluate
      children at risk for ASD.

TI  - Association Between Gestational Weight Gain and Perinatal Outcomes.
PG  - 875-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the association between gestational weight gain and
      maternal and neonatal outcomes in a large, geographically-diverse cohort.
      METHODS:: Trained chart abstractors at 25 hospitals obtained maternal and
      neonatal data for all deliveries on randomly selected days over 3 years
      (2008–2011). Gestational weight gain was derived using weight at delivery minus
      pre-pregnancy or first-trimester weight and categorized as below, within or above
      the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines in this retrospective cohort study.
      Maternal (primary or repeat cesarean birth, 3rd or 4th degree lacerations, severe
      postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disease of pregnancy) and neonatal (preterm
      birth, shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, hypoglycemia) outcomes were compared among 
      women in the gestational weight gain categories in unadjusted and adjusted
      analyses with ORs and 95%CI reported. Covariates included age, race-ethnicity,
      tobacco use, insurance type, parity, prior cesarean birth, pregestational
      diabetes, hypertension, and hospital type. RESULTS:: Of the 29,861 women
      included, 51% and 21% had gestational weight gain above and below the guidelines,
      respectively. There was an association between gestational weight gain above the 
      IOM guidelines and cesarean birth in both nulliparous women (aOR 1.44, 95%CI
      1.31–1.59) and multiparous women (aOR 1.26, 95%CI 1.13–1.41) and hypertensive
      diseases of pregnancy in nulliparous and multiparous women combined (aOR 1.84,
      95%CI 1.66–2.04). For the neonatal outcomes, gestational weight gain above the
      IOM guidelines was associated with shoulder dystocia (aOR 1.74, 95%CI
      1.41-.2.14), macrosomia (aOR 2.66, 95%CI 2.03–3.48), and neonatal hypoglycemia
      (aOR 1.60, 95%CI 1.16–2.22). Gestational weight gain below the guidelines was
      associated with spontaneous (aOR 1.50, 95%CI 1.31–1.73) and indicated (aOR 1.34, 
      95%CI 1.12–1.60) preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS:: In a large, diverse cohort with
      prospectively collected data, gestational weight gain below or above guidelines
      is associated with a variety of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Repeat HIV Testing by Transmission Risk Group and Rurality of Residence in North 
      Carolina.
PG  - 684-9
AB  - Background: Understanding of repeat HIV testing (RHT) is limited and the impact
      of rural residence as a potential barrier to RHT is unknown. Rural populations
      are of particular interest in the Southeastern United States because of their
      disproportionate HIV burden. Methods: We used HIV surveillance data from publicly
      funded HIV testing sites in North Carolina (NC) to assess repeat testing by
      transmission risk group and residential rurality in a retrospective cohort study.
      Linear binomial regression models were used to estimate adjusted, one-year
      cumulative incidences and cumulative incidence differences comparing RHT within
      transmission risk populations by level of rurality. Results: In our total study
      population of 600,613 persons, 19,275 (3.2%) and 9,567 (1.6%) self-identified as 
      men who have sex with men (MSM) and persons who inject drugs (PWID),
      respectively. 13,723 (2.3%) resided in rural ZIP codes. MSM were most likely to
      repeat test (unadjusted, one-year cumulative incidence after an initial negative 
      test = 16.4%), compared to PWID (13.2%) and persons who did not identify as
      either MSM or PWID (13.6%). The greatest effect of rurality was within PWID; the 
      adjusted, one-year cumulative incidence of RHT was 6.4 (95% CI: 1.4, 11.4)
      percentage points higher among metropolitan versus rural PWID. Conclusions:
      One-year cumulative incidence of RHT was low among all clients of publicly funded
      HIV testing sites in NC, including MSM and PWID for whom annual testing is
      recommended. Our findings suggest a need for public health efforts to increase
      access to and support for RHT, particularly among rural PWID.

TI  - Consolidation mFOLFOX6 Chemotherapy after Chemoradiotherapy Improves Survival in 
      Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer: Final Results of a Multicenter
      Phase II Trial.
PG  - 1146-55
AB  - BACKGROUND:: Adding modified FOLFOX6 (folinic acid, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin)
      after chemoradiotherapy and lengthening the chemoradiotherapy-to-surgery interval
      is associated with an increase in the proportion of rectal cancer patients with a
      pathological complete response. OBJECTIVE:: To analyze disease-free and overall
      survival. DESIGN:: Nonrandomized phase II trial. SETTINGS:: Multi-institutional. 
      PATIENTS:: Four sequential study groups with stage II or III rectal cancer.
      INTERVENTION:: All patients received 50 Gy of radiation with concurrent
      continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 5 weeks. Patients in each group received 
      0, 2, 4, or 6 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiation and before total
      mesorectal excision. Patients were recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy
      after surgery to complete a total of 8 cycles of modified FOLFOX6. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES:: The trial was powered to detect differences in pathological complete
      response, which was reported previously. Disease-free and overall survival are
      the main outcomes for the current study. RESULTS:: Of 259 patients, 211 had a
      complete follow-up. Median follow-up was 59 months (range, 9–125). The mean
      number of total chemotherapy cycles differed between the four groups (p = 0.002),
      as one third of patients in the group assigned to no preoperative FOLFOX did not 
      receive any adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease-free survival was significantly
      associated with study group, ypTNM stage, and pathological complete response (p =
      0.004, <0.001 and 0.001, respectively). A secondary analysis including only
      patients who received at least one cycle of FOLFOX still showed differences in
      survival between study groups (p = 0.03). LIMITATIONS:: The trial was not
      randomized and was not powered to show differences in survival. Survival data
      were not available for 19% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS:: Adding modified FOLFOX6
      after chemoradiotherapy and before total mesorectal excision increases compliance
      with systemic chemotherapy and disease-free survival in patients with locally
      advanced rectal cancer. Neoadjuvant consolidation chemotherapy may have benefits 
      beyond increasing pathological complete response rates. See Video Abstract at

TI  - Concordance between Proxy Level of Care Preference and Advance Directives among
      Nursing Home Residents with Advanced Dementia: A Cluster Randomized Clinical
      Trial.
PG  - 37-46.e1
AB  - Context:: Care consistent with goals is the desired outcome of advance care
      planning (ACP). Objectives:: To examine concordance between advance directives
      and proxy care preferences among nursing home residents with advanced dementia,
      and determine the impact of an ACP video on concordance. Methods:: Data were from
      Educational Video to Improve Nursing home Care in End-stage dementia (EVINCE); a 
      cluster randomized clinical trial conducted in 64 Boston-area facilities (32/arm)
      from 2013–2017. Participants included advanced dementia residents and their
      proxies (N=328 dyads). At baseline and quarterly (up to 12 months), proxies
      stated their preferred level of care for the resident (comfort, basic, or
      intensive) and advance directives for specific treatments (resuscitation,
      hospitalization, tube-feeding, intravenous hydration, antibiotics) were
      abstracted from the charts. At baseline, proxies in intervention facilities
      viewed an ACP video. Their care preferences after viewing it were shared via a
      written communication with the primary care team. At each assessment, concordance
      between directives and proxy preferences was determined. Results:: Among the
      residents (mean age, 86.6 years; 19.5% male), the most prevalent directive was
      DNR (89.3%) and foregoing antibiotics was least common (parenteral, 8.2%; any
      type, 4.0%). Concordance between directives and each level of care preference
      was: comfort, 7%; basic 49%; and intensive, 58%. When comfort care was preferred,
      concordance was higher in intervention versus control facilities (10.8% versus
      2.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.48, 95% confidence interval, 1.01–6.09).
      Conclusion:: Better alignment between preferences for comfort-focused care and
      advance directives is needed in advanced dementia. An ACP video may help achieve 
      that goal.

TI  - The association of metformin use with prostate cancer aggressiveness among Black 
      Americans and White Americans in a population-based study.
PG  - 1143-50
AB  - Purpose:: Metformin has been associated with a reduced incidence of prostate
      cancer and improved prostate cancer outcomes. However, whether race modifies the 
      association between metformin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness remains
      uncertain. The association between metformin use and prostate cancer
      aggressiveness was examined separately in Black Americans (Blacks) and White
      Americans (Whites). Methods:: The study population consisted of 305 Black and 195
      White research participants with incident prostate cancer and self-reported
      diabetes from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). High
      aggressive prostate cancer was defined using a composite measure of Gleason sum, 
      prostate-specific antigen, and clinical stage. Multivariable logistic regression 
      was used to assess the association between metformin use and high aggressive
      prostate cancer at diagnosis, separately among Whites and Blacks, with adjustment
      for age, screening history, site, education, insurance, and body mass index.
      Results:: Metformin use was associated positively with high aggressive prostate
      cancer in Blacks (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.83). By contrast, a weak inverse
      association between metformin use and high aggressive prostate cancer was found
      in Whites (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.34, 1.85). Conclusions:: The association between
      metformin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness may be modified by race.

TI  - Extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid in high-risk and normal-risk children with autism
      aged 2–4 years: a case-control study.
PG  - 895-904
AB  - Background:: We previously showed, in two separate cohorts, that high-risk
      infants who were later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder had abnormally
      high extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume from age 6–24 months. The
      presence of increased extra-axial CSF volume preceded the onset of behavioural
      symptoms of autism and was predictive of a later diagnosis of autism spectrum
      disorder. In this study, we aimed to establish whether increased extra-axial CSF 
      volume is found in a large, independent sample of children diagnosed with autism 
      spectrum disorder, whether extra-axial CSF remains abnormally increased beyond
      infancy, and whether it is present in both normal-risk and high-risk children
      with autism. Methods:: In this case-control MRI study, children with autism
      spectrum disorder or with typical development aged 2–4 years were recruited from 
      the community to the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project, based in
      Sacramento, CA, USA. The autism spectrum disorder group comprised children with
      autism spectrum disorder who were either normal risk (ie, from simplex families) 
      or high risk (ie, from multiplex families). Measurements of extra-axial CSF
      volume, brain volume, head circumference, sleep problems, and familial risk
      status were derived from MRI and behavioural assessments. We applied a previously
      validated machine learning algorithm based on extra-axial CSF volume, brain
      volume, age, and sex to the current dataset. Findings:: Between July 20, 2007,
      and Dec 13, 2012, 159 children with autism spectrum disorder (132 male, 27
      female) and 77 with typical development (49 male, 28 female) underwent MRI scans.
      The autism spectrum disorder group had an average of 15·1% more extra-axial CSF
      than controls after accounting for differences in brain volume, weight, age, and 
      sex (least-squares mean 116·74 cm3 [SE 3·33] in autism group vs 101·40 cm3 [3·93]
      in typical development group; p=0·007; Cohen’s d=0·39). Subgroups of normal-risk 
      (n=132) and high-risk (n=27) children with autism spectrum disorder had nearly
      identical extra-axial CSF volumes (p=0·78), and both subgroups had significantly 
      greater volumes than controls. Both extra-axial CSF volume (p=0·004) and brain
      volume (p<0·0001) uniquely contributed to enlarged head circumference in the
      autism spectrum disorder group (p=0·04). Increased extra-axial CSF volume was
      associated with greater sleep disturbances (p=0·03) and lower non-verbal ability 
      (p=0·04). The machine learning algorithm correctly predicted autism spectrum
      disorder diagnosis with a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI 76·2–88·3).
      Interpretation:: Increased extra-axial CSF volume is a reliable brain anomaly
      that has now been found in three independent cohorts, comprising both high-risk
      and normal-risk children with autism spectrum disorder. Increased extra-axial CSF
      volume is detectable using conventional structural MRI scans from infancy through
      to age 3 years. These results suggest that increased extra-axial CSF volume could
      be an early stratification biomarker of a biologically based subtype of autism
      that might share a common underlying pathophysiology.

TI  - Genetic Tools for Coronary Risk Assessment in Type 2 Diabetes: A Cohort Study
      From the ACCORD Clinical Trial.
PG  - 2404-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether the increasing number of genetic loci for
      coronary artery disease (CAD) identified in the general population could be used 
      to predict the risk of major CAD events (MCE) among participants with type 2
      diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A weighted
      genetic risk score (GRS) derived from 204 variants representative of all the 160 
      CAD loci identified in the general population as of December 2017 was calculated 
      in 5,360 and 1,931 white participants in the Action to Control Cardiovascular
      Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) and Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine
      Intervention (ORIGIN) studies, respectively. The association between GRS and MCE 
      (combining fatal CAD events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina)
      was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: The GRS was
      associated with MCE risk in both ACCORD and ORIGIN (hazard ratio [HR] per SD
      1.27, 95% CI 1.18–1.37, P = 4 × 10−10, and HR per SD 1.35, 95% CI 1.16–1.58, P = 
      2 × 10−4, respectively). This association was independent from interventions
      tested in the trials and persisted, though attenuated, after adjustment for
      classic cardiovascular risk predictors. Adding the GRS to clinical predictors
      improved incident MCE risk classification (relative integrated discrimination
      improvement +8%, P = 7 × 10−4). The performance of this GRS was superior to that 
      of GRS based on the smaller number of CAD loci available in previous years.
      CONCLUSIONS: When combined into a GRS, CAD loci identified in the general
      population are associated with CAD also in type 2 diabetes. This GRS provides a
      significant improvement in the ability to correctly predict future MCE, which may
      increase further with the discovery of new CAD loci.

TI  - Self-reported myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease among oil
      spill workers and community members 5 years after Deepwater Horizon.
PG  - 70-9
AB  - Background:: Chemical, physical and psychological stressors due to the 2010
      Deepwater Horizon oil spill may impact coronary heart disease (CHD) among exposed
      populations. Using longitudinal information from two interviews in the Gulf Long 
      Term Follow-up (GuLF) STUDY, we assessed CHD among oil spill workers and
      community members. Objective:: To assess the associations between duration of oil
      spill clean-up work, residential proximity to the oil spill, and incidence of
      self-reported myocardial infarction or fatal CHD. Methods:: Among respondents
      with two GuLF STUDY interviews (n=21,256), there were 395 first incident heart
      disease events (self-reported myocardial infarction or fatal CHD) across 5 years.
      We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for
      associations with duration of oil spill clean-up work and residential proximity
      to the oil spill. To assess potential impacts of non-response, we compared
      covariate distributions for those who did (n=21,256) and did not (n=10,353)
      complete the second interview and used inverse probability (IP) of censoring
      weights to correct for potential non-response bias. Results:: Living in proximity
      to the oil spill (vs. living further away) was associated with heart disease,
      with [HR(95%CI)=1.30(1.01–1.67)] and without [1.29(1.00–1.65)] censoring weights.
      For work duration, hazard of heart disease appeared to be higher for those who
      worked >180 days (vs. 1–30 days), with and without censoring weights
      [1.43(0.91–2.25) and 1.36(0.88–2.11), respectively]. Associations persisted
      throughout the 5-year follow-up. Conclusions:: Residential proximity to the spill
      and duration of clean-up work were associated with a suggested 29–43% higher
      hazard of heart disease events. Associations were robust to censoring.

TI  - Neurotensin and Dynorphin Bi-Directionally Modulate CeA Inhibition of oval BNST
      Neurons in Male Mice.
PG  - 113-21
AB  - Neuropeptides are often co-expressed in neurons, and may therefore be working
      together to coordinate proper neural circuit function. However,
      neurophysiological effects of neuropeptides are commonly studied individually
      possibly underestimating their modulatory roles. Here, we triggered the release
      of endogenous neuropeptides in brain slices from male mice to better understand
      their modulation of central amygdala (CeA) inhibitory inputs onto oval (ov) BNST 
      neurons. We found that locally-released neurotensin (NT) and dynorphin (Dyn)
      antagonistically regulated CeA inhibitory inputs onto ovBNST neurons. NT and Dyn 
      respectively increased and decreased CeA-to-ovBNST inhibitory inputs through NT
      receptor 1 (NTR1) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Additionally, NT and Dyn mRNAs
      were highly co-localized in ovBNST neurons suggesting that they may be released
      from the same cells. Together, we showed that NT and Dyn are key modulators of
      CeA inputs to ovBNST, paving the way to determine whether different conditions or
      states can alter the neuropeptidergic regulation of this particular brain
      circuit.

TI  - The Effect of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Adoption on Facility-Level Breast
      Cancer Screening Volume.
PG  - 957-63
AB  - Objective:: To determine whether digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) adoption was 
      associated with a decrease in screening mammography capacity across Breast Cancer
      Screening Consortium (BCSC) facilities given concerns about increasing imaging
      and interpretation times associated with DBT. Materials and Methods:: Facility
      characteristics and examination volume data were collected prospectively from
      BCSC facilities that adopted DBT between 2011 and 2014. Interrupted time series
      analyses using Poisson regression models with facility as a random effect were
      used to evaluate differences between monthly screening volumes during the
      12-month pre-adoption period and 12-month post-adoption period (separated by a
      3-month lag period) and to test for changes in month-to-month facility-level
      screening volume during the pre-adoption and post-adoption periods. Results::
      Across five regional breast imaging registries, 15 out of 83 (18.1%) facilities
      adopted DBT for screening between 2011 and 2014. The majority had no academic
      affiliation (73.3%, 11/15), were non-profit (80.0%, 12/15), and were general
      radiology practices (66.7%, 10/15). Facility-level monthly screening volumes were
      slightly higher during the post- vs. pre- adoption periods (relative risk [RR] = 
      1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–1.11). Monthly screening volumes remained
      relatively stable within the pre-adoption period (RR = 1.00 per month, 95% CI
      1.00–1.01) and the post-adoption period (1.00, 95% CI 1.00–1.01). Conclusion:: In
      a cohort of facilities with varied characteristics, monthly screening examination
      volumes did not decrease after DBT adoption.

TI  - Methylation of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Genomes are Associated with
      Cervical Precancer in HIV-positive Women.
PG  - 1407-15
AB  - Background:: HIV-positive women are at substantial risk of HPV-associated
      cervical neoplasia caused by high-risk (HR) HPVs. Methylation of the HPV genome
      is associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) in
      HIV-negative women, yet it is unknown whether this holds true for HIV-positive
      women. Methods:: We designed a case-control study within the WIHS cohort
      comparing HIV-positive CIN3 cases (N=72) to HIV-positive controls without
      detectable CIN2+. The unit of analysis and matching was HPV type infection. Cases
      with ≥2 HR-HPV types (N=23; 32%) had a separate control for each HR-HPV type. We 
      developed and utilized next generation sequencing (NGS) methylation assays for 12
      different HR-HPVs, focusing on CpG sites in the L1/L2 regions. Results::
      Significant case-control differences in individual CpG site methylation levels
      were observed for multiple alpha-9 (HPV16/31/35/58) and alpha-7 HPV (HPV18/39/45)
      types, based on dichotomization of tertile levels (T3 versus T1 and T2). Analyses
      combining homologous CpG sites (e.g.,
      HPV16-L1–5608/HPV31-L1–5521/HPV35-L2L1–5570; odds ratio [OR]=7.28; 95%
      CI:2.75–19.3), and (e.g., HPV18-L1–7062/HPV45-L1–7066 OR=6.94; 95% CI:1.23–39.3) 
      were significant in separate case-control comparisons. In cases with multiple
      HR-HPVs, we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that one HR-HPV type would have
      higher methylation than other types detected, consistent with there being a
      single HR-HPV causally-related to a lesion. Conclusion:: CIN3 is associated with 
      elevated L1/L2 CpG methylation levels in HIV-positive women. Impact:: HPV DNA CpG
      methylation is a promising triage option in HIV-positive women testing positive
      for HR-HPV types and provides risk attribution in women with multiple HPV type
      infections.

TI  - PD-L1 expression and CD8-positive T cells are associated with favorable survival 
      in HER2-positive invasive breast cancer.
PG  - 911-9
AB  - Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are key physiologic
      suppressors of the cytotoxic immune reaction. However, to date, the combination
      of PD1/PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and
      antigen-presenting cells has been only minimally reported in breast carcinoma, in
      particular in relation to HER2-positive cases. The goal of this study was to
      evaluate both cellular tumoral immune reaction and PD-L1/PD1 distribution in
      HER2-positive cases, as well as any associations with clinical outcome using
      conventional chemotherapy combined with HER2 blocking. Multicolor
      immunohistochemical multiplex assays simultaneously demonstrating PD1, PD-L1, and
      CD8 or PD-L1, CD3, and CD163 were performed on tissue microarrays (TMA)
      representing 216 pretreatment cases of HER2-positive invasive breast carcinoma.
      PD-L1 expression was identified in 38 cases (18%), including 12 cases (6%) with
      PD-L1 labeling of tumor cells and 26 cases (12%) with PD-L1 labeling of immune
      cells only. Ten of 12 cases with PD-L1 staining of tumor cells showed staining of
      associated immune cells as well. With this assay method, PD1 was detectable in
      many fewer cases (6 cases or 3%). PD-L1 expression was positively associated with
      high Nottingham grade, negative ER and PR, the absence of lymph node metastasis, 
      and high levels of CD8+ cells. The overall survival by univariate analysis was
      positively associated with lower tumor stage, the absence of lymph node
      metastasis, PD-L1 expression, and high levels of CD8+ cells. Therefore, our data 
      suggest cytotoxic immune reaction mediated by CD8-positive T cells and PD-L1
      expression may predict a better outcome in patients with HER2-positive breast
      carcinoma managed with conventional chemotherapy and HER2-blocking therapy. These
      findings recommend clinical trials utilizing checkpoint blocking immunotherapy in
      some form for HER2-positive breast cancer.

TI  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers and incident pregnancy loss: The LIFE Study.
PG  - 375-81
AB  - Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have not been studied in
      relation to incident pregnancy loss in human populations, despite their
      ubiquitous exposure and purported reproductive toxicity. Objectives: To
      investigate the association between preconception serum PBDE concentrations and
      incident pregnancy loss. Methods: A preconception cohort of 501 couples was
      followed while trying to become pregnant, and for whom serum concentrations of 10
      PBDE congeners were measured using gas chromatography-high resolution mass
      spectrometry. Pregnancy was prospectively identified as a positive home pregnancy
      test on the day of expected menstruation. Incident pregnancy loss was defined for
      344 singleton pregnancies as a conversion to a negative home pregnancy test,
      menses, or clinical diagnosis depending upon gestational age. Cox proportional
      hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) for individual and summed PBDEs and incident pregnancy loss,
      adjusting for relevant covariates and male partners’ information. In sensitivity 
      analyses, inverse probability weighting was used to account for couples not
      becoming pregnant and, thereby, not at risk for loss. Results: The incidence of
      prospectively observed pregnancy loss was 28%, and the serum concentrations of
      PBDE congeners in females were consistently associated with a higher hazard of
      incident pregnancy loss. Specifically, statistically significant hazard ratios
      (HRs) for incident pregnancy loss were observed for lower brominated PBDE
      congeners: 17 (HR 1.23; CI: 1.07–1.42), 28 (HR 1.25; CI: 1.03–1.52), 66 (HR 1.23;
      CI: 1.07–1.42), and homolog triBDE (HR: 1.25; CI: 1.05–1.49). Findings were
      robust to various model specifications explored in sensitivity analyses.
      Conclusions: Maternal preconception serum concentrations of specific PBDE
      congeners may increase the hazard of incident pregnancy.

TI  - Trends in documented co-occurring conditions in children with autism spectrum
      disorder, 2002–2010.
PG  - 168-78
AB  - Background:: Autism spectrumdisorder (ASD) commonly presents with co-occurring
      medical conditions (CoCs). Little is known about patterns in CoCs in a time of
      rising ASD prevalence. Aims:: To describe trends in number and type of documented
      CoCs in 8-year-old children with ASD. Methods:: We used Autism and Developmental 
      Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM) data, a multi-source active surveillance
      system monitoring ASD prevalence among 8-year-old children across the US. Data
      from surveillance years 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2010 were used to describe trends
      in count, categories, and individual CoCs. Results:: Mean number of CoCs
      increased from 0.94 CoCs in 2002 to 1.06 CoCs in 2010 (p < 0.001). The percentage
      of children with ASD with any CoC increased from 44.5% to 56.4% (p < 0.001). CoCs
      with the greatest increases were in general developmental disability (10.4% to
      14.5%), language disorder (18.9% to 23.6%), and motor developmental disability
      (10.5% to 15.6%). Sex modified the relationship between developmental (P = 0.02) 
      and psychiatric (P < 0.001) CoCs and surveillance year. Race/ethnicity modified
      the relationship between neurological conditions (P = 0.04) and surveillance
      year. Conclusions:: The increase in the percentage of children with ASD and CoCs 
      may suggest the ASD phenotype has changed over time or clinicians are more likely
      to diagnose CoCs.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Determinants of Cisplatin-Induced Subclinical Kidney Injury in
      Oncology Patients.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - Purpose: The ability to predict and detect clinical and subclinical
      nephrotoxicity early in the course of therapy has the potential to improve
      long-term outcomes in cancer patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.
      Pharmacokinetic parameters could serve as predictors of cisplatin-induced
      nephrotoxicity. Methods: Participants [n=13] were treated with a one-hour
      cisplatin infusion [30–75 mg/m2]. Blood was collected pre-dose and up to 6 h
      post-dose. Urinary biomarkers [KIM-1, calbindin, clusterin, GST-pi, β2M, albumin,
      NGAL, osteopontin, clusterin, MCP-1, cystatin C and TFF3] were measured at
      baseline, day 3 and day 10. Total and unbound platinum concentrations were
      measured using ICP/MS. Noncompartmental analysis was performed and correlation
      and regression analyses evaluated the relationships between platinum
      pharmacokinetics and nephrotoxicity. Results: Peak platinum urinary
      concentrations correlated with urinary levels of KIM-1, calbindin, clusterin,
      GST-pi, β2M, albumin, NGAL, osteopontin, clusterin, cystatin C and TFF3 at day
      10. Unbound platinum plasma concentrations at 2 h also correlated with urinary
      clusterin, β2M, cystatin C, NGAL, osteopontin, and TFF3 at day 3. Regression
      analyses suggested 2 h total plasma platinum concentrations greater than 2,000
      ng/ml and peak urinary platinum concentrations above 24,000 ng/ml may serve as
      potential approximations for elevated risk of nephrotoxicity. Platinum area under
      the plasma concentration time curve was associated with serum creatinine and
      estimated glomerular filtration rate. Conclusions: Peak plasma and urinary
      platinum concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters were associated with risk 
      of subclinical cisplatin-induced kidney injury as assessed using novel urinary
      biomarkers. Future studies will examine these relationships in larger clinical
      populations of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.

TI  - Sociodemographic Associations of Longitudinal Adiposity in Youth with Type 1
      Diabetes.
PG  - 1429-40
AB  - Excess adiposity is common in youth with type 1 diabetes, yet little is known
      about the sociodemographic factors that predict longitudinal trajectories of body
      fat. We analyzed data from 363 females and 379 males with type 1 diabetes over ~9
      years of follow-up (mean baseline age 12.8 ± 2.3 in females, 13.2 ± 2.4 in
      males). Estimated body fat percentage (eBFP) was calculated with validated sex-
      and race/ethnicity-specific equations. Group-based modeling identified three eBFP
      trajectories for each sex. All female trajectories showed gradual increases while
      male trajectories showed gradual decreases (<5% in eBFP) that plateaued around 7 
      years of diabetes duration. Female trajectories showed differences in baseline
      eBFP: Group F1 (38.0%), mean eBFP 27.8±3.0%; Group F2 (47.9%), mean eBFP
      33.9±3.0%; Group F3 (14.1%), mean eBFP 41.7±4.1%. Male trajectories also showed
      differences in baseline eBFP: Group M1 (57.2%), mean eBFP 22.0±3.0%; Group M2
      (30.9%); mean eBFP 33.9±3.0%; Group M3 (12.9%), mean eBFP 36.1±3.7%. In
      multinomial models adjusted clinical factors (e.g. insulin regimen, insulin dose,
      and hemoglobin A1c), females who reported a single-parent household (adjusted OR 
      (aOR)=3.34, 95% CI 1.49, 7.47), parental education of less than a college degree 
      (aOR=3.79, 95% CI 1.60, 9.60), and a lack of private health insurance (aOR=3.74, 
      95% CI 1.45, 9.60), and a household income of less than $75,000 per year
      (aOR=3.13 (95% CI 1.27, 7.70) were approximately 3–4 times more likely to be in
      the highest eBFP trajectory group relative to the lowest eBFP trajectory group.
      Males who reported a household income <$75000/year were almost twice as likely to
      be in Group M3 than Group M1 in the unadjusted model only (aOR=1.79, 95% CI 0.91,
      4.01 versus unadjusted OR: 2.48, 95% CI 1.22, 5.06). Lower socioeconomic status
      may be associated with excess body fat throughout adolescence in type 1 diabetes,
      particularly among females.

TI  - Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviors of Children in Family Child Care Homes:
      Are There Opportunities for Improvement?
PG  - 529-36
AB  - Purpose:: Many children attend family child care homes (FCCHs), an important
      setting to influence children’s physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior
      (SB). This study assessed children’s PA and SB while in FCCHs, characteristics of
      the FCCH PA environment, and relationships between the environment and child PA
      and SB. Method:: Children ages 1.5–4.0 years (n = 495) were recruited from 165
      FCCHs in North Carolina. Children’s moderate to vigorous PA and SB were measured 
      via accelerometry for 3 days. FCCH PA environments were assessed over 2 days
      using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation for FCCHs. Ten
      subscores and an overall PA environment score (possible range: 0–30) were
      calculated; higher scores indicate better quality. Results:: Children accumulated
      30 (13) minutes of moderate to vigorous PA and 143 (42) minutes of SB in FCCHs
      daily. FCCHs scored low on the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation 
      for FCCHs, with an average overall score of 13 (2). FCCHs scored highest on
      screen time and screen time practices subscores, and lowest on PA
      education/professional development and PA policy subscores. Although no
      statistically significant associations were observed, some large Cohen d effect
      sizes were noted (eg, outdoor playtime subscore and moderate to vigorous PA).
      Conclusions:: This study highlights opportunities to improve FCCHs and increase
      children’s behaviors (eg, providing adequate time and outdoor play spaces).

TI  - Effects of Supplemental Calcium and Vitamin D on Expression of Toll-Like
      Receptors and Phospho-IKKα/β in the Normal Rectal Mucosa of Colorectal Adenoma
      Patients.
PG  - 707-16
AB  - Chronic inflammation in the colorectum, a significant contributor to colorectal
      carcinogenesis, can be triggered by the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling 
      pathways such as those initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nuclear factor
      κB (NF-κB). Although experimental evidence supports calcium and vitamin D
      potentially modifying these pro-inflammatory pathways in the colorectum, human
      data in these regards are scarce. We investigated supplemental calcium (1,200 mg 
      daily) and/or vitamin D3 (1,000 IU daily) effects on inflammatory signaling
      pathway-related biomarkers in a subset of 105 participants from a colorectal
      adenoma recurrence chemoprevention clinical trial. We assessed expression of TLR4
      and TLR5, which recognize the bacterial components lipopolysaccharides and
      flagellin, respectively, and phospho-IKKα/β (pIKKα/β), a biomarker of
      inflammation, in the normal-appearing rectal crypt epithelium and stroma using
      standardized, automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis.
      Following one year of treatment, TLR4, TLR5, and pIKKα/β expression in the rectal
      mucosa did not statistically significantly change with vitamin D or calcium
      supplementation, taken alone or in combination. Several baseline participant
      characteristics, including body mass index, history of sessile serrated adenomas,
      high red/processed meat intake, and high levels of rectal epithelial cell
      proliferation (as measured by MIB-1/Ki-67), were associated with higher baseline 
      expression of TLRs or pIKKα/β. Our findings suggest that vitamin D and calcium
      may have no substantial effect on the investigated biomarkers. However, several
      modifiable lifestyle factors may be associated with TLRs and pIKKα/β expression
      in the normal rectal mucosa, supporting their future investigation as potentially
      treatable, pre-neoplastic risk factors for colorectal neoplasms.

TI  - Temporal Trends in Co-trimoxazole Use Among Children on Antiretroviral Therapy
      and the Impact of Co-trimoxazole on Mortality Rates in Children Without Severe
      Immunodeficiency.
PG  - 450-60
AB  - Background: Co-trimoxazole is recommended for all children with human
      immunodeficiency virus. In this analysis, we evaluate trends in pediatric
      co-trimoxazole use and survival on co-trimoxazole in children using
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: We used data collected between January 1, 
      2006, and March 31, 2016, from the International Epidemiology Databases to
      Evaluate AIDS. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with
      using co-trimoxazole at ART initiation. Competing risk regression was used to
      assess factors associated with death. Results: A total of 54113 children were
      included in this study. The prevalence of co-trimoxazole use at ART initiation
      increased from 66.5% in 2006 to a peak of 85.6% in 2010 and then declined to
      48.5% in 2015–2016. A similar trend was observed among children who started ART
      with severe immunodeficiency. After adjusting for year of ART initiation, younger
      age (odds ratio [OR], 1.18 for <1 vs 1 to <5 years of age [95% confidence
      interval (CI), 1.09–1.28]), lower height-for-age z score (OR, 1.15 for less than 
      −3 vs greater than −2 [95% CI, 1.08–1.22]), anemia (OR, 1.08 [95% CI,
      1.02–1.15]), severe immunodeficiency (OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.18–1.32]), and
      receiving care in East Africa (OR, 8.97 vs Southern Africa [95% CI, 8.17–9.85])
      were associated with a high prevalence of co-trimoxazole use. Survival did not
      differ according to co-trimoxazole use in children without severe
      immunodeficiency (hazard ratio, 1.01 for nonusers versus users [95% CI,
      0.77–1.34]). Conclusions: Recent declines in co-trimoxazole use may not be linked
      to the current shift toward early ART initiation. Randomized trial data might be 
      needed to establish the survival benefit of co-trimoxazole in children without
      severe immunodeficiency.

TI  - Generalizing Intensive Blood Pressure Treatment to Adults With Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 1214-23
AB  - Background:: Controversy over blood pressure treatment targets for individuals
      with diabetes is in part due to conflicting perspectives about generalizability
      of available trial data. Objective:: To estimate how results from the largest
      clinical trial of intensive blood pressure treatment among adults with diabetes
      would generalize to the U.S. population. Methods:: We used transportability
      methods to re-weight individual patient data from the ACCORD BP trial (n=4507) of
      intensive (goal systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 120 mm Hg) vs. standard (goal SBP
      <140 mm Hg) treatment to better represent the demographic and clinical risk
      factors of U.S. population of adults with diabetes (data from NHANES 2005-2014,
      n=1943). The primary outcome was the first occurrence of non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Analysis used weighted Cox
      proportional hazards regression models with robust standard errors. Results:: The
      ACCORD BP sample had less racial/ethnic diversity and more elevated
      cardiovascular risk factors than NHANES participants. Weighted results
      significantly favored intensive BP treatment, unlike unweighted results (hazard
      ratio [HR] for primary outcome in intensive versus standard treatment in weighted
      analyses: 0.67, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.49 to 0.91; in unweighted
      analyses: HR 0.88, 95%CI 0.73 to 1.07). Over 5 years, the weighted results
      estimate a number needed to treat of 34, and number needed to harm of 55.
      Conclusions:: After re-weighting to better reflect the U.S. adult population with
      diabetes, intensive BP therapy was associated with significantly lower risk for
      cardiovascular events. However, data were limited among racial/ethnic minorities 
      and those with lower cardiovascular risk.

TI  - The Effects of Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring on Sleep Quality in Men and
      Women With Hypertension: Dipper vs. Nondipper and Race Differences.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nondipping circadian blood pressure (BP) profile is associated
      with both poor sleep quality and increased cardiovascular risk. The present study
      aimed to clarify the potential confounding effects of 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring (ABPM) used to characterize the circadian BP profile by
      assessing its impact on sleep quality. METHODS: Participants were 121 middle-aged
      men and women with untreated hypertension (age = 46 ± 8 years; 43% women; 45%
      African-American). Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index. Wrist actigraphy was used to measure sleep quality
      objectively as sleep efficiency (SE) and total sleep time (TST) on 7 consecutive 
      non-ABPM days (baseline) and 3 subsequent 24-hour ABPM days. RESULTS: Average
      ambulatory BP was 137.2 ± 10.8/84.3 ± 8.5 mm Hg during the day and 119.6 ±
      12.4/69.5 ± 9.8 mm Hg at night. Using the criterion of <10% dip in systolic BP
      (SBP) to define nondippers, there were 40 nondippers (SBP dip = 7.3 ± 2.6%) and
      81 dippers (SBP dip = 15.5 ± 3.4%). There was no effect of time on SE or TST over
      non-ABPM and ABPM days, suggesting that ABPM does not adversely affect sleep
      quality. Sleep quality was generally poorer (lower SE) in nondippers compared
      with dippers (P = 0.033), but differences were independent of whether or not
      participants were undergoing 24-hour ABPM. African-American race (P = 0.002) was 
      also associated with lower SE. CONCLUSION: Sleep quality generally appears to be 
      poor in men and women with untreated hypertension and especially among
      African-Americans. Importantly, for both dippers and nondippers, we found no
      evidence that ABPM had an adverse effect on sleep quality.

TI  - Oral Health Trajectories in Community-dwelling Older Adults in the Last Three
      Years of Life.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - Background:: Systemic health and physical, cognitive and social function
      gradually decline at the end of life. How oral health change at the end of life
      in community-dwelling older adults remains unknown, increasing the difficulty in 
      treatment planning for these individuals. Methods:: 250 community-dwelling
      decedents of a longitudinal study were included in the analysis. Decedents’
      clinical and interview data collected at baseline, 18, 36, 60 and 84 month were
      linked to their death dates and plotted on an inverted time scale to study their 
      oral health changes in the three years prior to death. Mixed effect models with
      random intercepts and slopes of months from death and socio-demographic variables
      were used to model the subjective and objective oral health trajectories in the
      last three years of life. The association of the change in the outcomes with a
      linear trend of months from death were assessed using the F-test. Results::
      Number of missing teeth was significantly associated with a linear trend of
      months from death. With every month in proximity to death, the expected number of
      missing teeth increased by 0.03 (SE=0.004; P<0.001), resulting in an average of
      1.08 missing teeth in three years. Among subjective outcomes, the odds of good
      versus poor or “neither” self-rated systemic health (P=0.009) and mouth
      appearance (P=0.008) significantly decreased as death approached. Conclusion::
      While other oral health measures remained relatively stable, tooth loss and
      dissatisfaction with mouth appearance steadily increased in community-dwelling
      older adults as death approached. These changes were gradual and parallel the
      end-of-life general health decline.

      produced inconsistent results. We employed a longitudinal study design to assess 
      the stability of three clinical sensory response patterns: hyporesponsiveness;
      hyperresponsiveness; and sensory interests, repetitions, and seeking behaviors
      (SIRS). Parents of children with ASD (n = 55) or DD (n = 35) responded to sensory
      questionnaires at two time points (T1 and T2) separated by 3.3 years on average, 
      with the children aged 2–12 years (M = 5.69 ± 2.46) at the first assessment. For 
      each sensory response pattern, regression analysis revealed that, for both ASD
      and DD groups, scores at T1 were strong predictors of scores at T2. Over the
      longitudinal assessment interval, there was a significant mean decline in
      severity for SIRS in both groups and for hyporesponsiveness in the ASD group.
      Parental estimates of the amount of therapy services received were positively
      associated with the severity of sensory features at T2, an outcome that may
      result from increased intervention dosages being administered to children who
      fail to improve over time. The results are discussed in terms of person-centered 
      and environmental considerations, which, in combination, have the capacity to
      affect stability outcomes for sensory features.

TI  - HPA axis response and psychosocial stress as interactive predictors of suicidal
      ideation and behavior in adolescent females: a multilevel diathesis-stress
      framework.
PG  - 2564-71
AB  - Prior studies suggest that hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis stress
      response is a relatively stable risk factor for suicidal behavior in adults, and 
      also that fluctuations in developmentally salient social stress (i.e., peer
      stress) predict acute suicidal ideation and behavior in adolescent females. Here,
      we test the hypothesis that periods of high peer stress are prospectively
      associated with concurrent episodes of suicidal ideation and behavior, but that
      abnormal cortisol responses to stress at baseline act as a diathesis that
      strengthens this stressor–suicidality link, using a longitudinal, multi-wave
      study design. We measured cortisol responses to an adolescent modification of the
      Trier Social Stress Test in 220 adolescent females recruited for mental health
      concerns, and measured stress (peer, academic, and mother-child) and suicidal
      ideation and behaviors repeatedly across 18 months. Logistic multilevel models
      revealed the predicted interaction between altered cortisol response and elevated
      periods of peer stress in predicting suicidal behavior, but not ideation.
      Higher-than-usual peer stress predicted suicidal ideation regardless of HPA
      function, but predicted suicide attempt only among those with blunted cortisol
      responses. Results suggest that peer stress serves to trigger suicidal ideation
      among female youth, but only triggers suicidal behavior among those with blunted 
      cortisol reactivity.

TI  - High-dose influenza vaccine use among patients receiving hemodialysis in the
      United States, 2010 – 2013.
PG  - 6087-94
AB  - Background:: Standard influenza vaccines may be of limited benefit to patients
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). These patients may benefit from high-dose
      influenza vaccine, currently indicated for patients aged ≥65 years. Studies in
      other populations have demonstrated that high-dose vaccine elicits a stronger
      immunological response. We compared vaccine uptake in the United States and
      predictors of receipt for high-dose and standard influenza vaccines. Methods::
      Using data from the United States Renal Data System (2010–2013), we conducted a
      retrospective cohort study of 421,482 adult patients on hemodialysis. We examined
      temporal trends in uptake of high-dose or standard trivalent influenza vaccine
      each influenza season, and used multivariate logistic regression to assess the
      association between individual-level variables (e.g., demographics,
      comorbidities) and facility-level variables (e.g., facility size and type) with
      vaccine receipt. Results:: The proportion of patients with ESRD who were
      vaccinated with any influenza vaccine increased from 68.3% in 2010 to 72.4% in
      2013. High-dose vaccines were administered to 0.9% of patients during the study
      period, and 16.7% of high-dose vaccines were administered to patients <65 years
      of age. Among patients aged ≥65 years, older patients (>79 vs. 65–69 years: OR,
      1.29; 95% CI, 1.19–1.41) and patients at hospital-based versus free-standing
      dialysis facilities (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.13–2.45) were more likely to receive
      high-dose vaccine, while blacks (vs. whites [OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61–0.71]) and
      patients with longer duration of ERSD (>9 vs. 0 years: OR, 0.66; 95% CI,
      0.55–0.78) were less likely to receive the high-dose vaccine. Conclusions:: While
      the overall influenza vaccination rate has increased, use of high-dose vaccine
      among patients with ESRD was very low. Being an older patient, living in the
      Midwest, and receiving care at hospital-based facilities were the strongest
      predictors of receiving high-dose vaccine.

TI  - A Scalable, Integrated Intervention to Engage People Who Inject Drugs in HIV Care
      and Medication-Assisted Treatment: A Randomized, Controlled Vanguard Trial (HPTN 
      074).
PG  - 747-59
AB  - Background:: People who inject drugs (PWID) experience high HIV incidence,
      limited access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medication-assisted treatment 
      (MAT), and high mortality. We report the effect of an integrated, flexible
      intervention on HIV and substance use outcomes. Methods:: HIV Prevention Trials
      Network 074 was a randomized, controlled vanguard study conducted in Ukraine,
      Indonesia, and Vietnam and designed to assess the feasibility of a future trial. 
      HIV-infected PWID index participants (indexes) were enrolled with ≥1
      HIV-uninfected injection partner. Indexes were randomly assigned (ratio=3:1) to
      standard of care (SOC) or an intervention comprising systems navigation,
      psychosocial counseling, and ART at any CD4 count. Local ART and MAT services
      were used. Outcomes included retention, ART use, viral suppression, MAT use,
      mortality, and injection partner HIV incidence. Findings:: 502 indexes and 806
      partners were enrolled. At 52 weeks, most living indexes (86%) and partners (80%)
      were retained. At week 52, self-reported ART use was higher among intervention
      indexes (72%) than SOC indexes (43%) (probability ratio (PR) 1.7, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.4, 1.9). Viral suppression also increased (intervention: 41%,
      SOC: 24%; PR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.2). Intervention indexes reported more MAT use 
      at 52 weeks (41%; SOC 25%; PR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.2). Mortality was reduced with
      the intervention (indexes: hazard ratio (HR): 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.90; partners:
      HR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.84). All incident HIV infections occurred in SOC
      partners (intervention (0 cases): 0.0/100 person-years; 95% CI: 0, 1.7; SOC (7
      cases): 1.0/100 person-years, 95% CI: 0.4, 2.1; incidence rate difference:
      −1.0/100 person-years (95% CI: −2.1, 1.1)). Interpretation:: This randomized,
      controlled vanguard trial provides strong evidence that a flexible, scalable
      intervention increases ART and MAT use and reduces mortality among PWID. The
      intervention may also reduce HIV transmission to injection partners.

TI  - Association of Patterns of Change in Adiposity with Diastolic Function and
      Systolic Myocardial Mechanics from Early Adulthood to Middle Age: The Coronary
      Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study.
PG  - 1261-1269.e8
AB  - Background:: The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term patterns of
      change in adiposity throughout young adulthood are associated with systolic and
      diastolic function in midlife. Methods:: Participants in the Coronary Artery Risk
      Development in Young Adults study, a multicenter, population-based cohort,
      underwent repeated anthropometric assessment (body mass index [BMI], waist
      circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) from examination years 0 to 25. At year
      25, longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain and tissue Doppler
      velocities were assessed by echocardiography. Group-based trajectory modeling was
      used to identify 25-year trajectories of change in anthropometric measures and to
      examine associations between trajectories of adiposity change and indices of
      cardiac mechanics. Results:: Among 3,310 participants, four distinct trajectories
      of BMI change were identified: stable BMI (36% of the cohort; mean εBMI, 1.6
      kg/m2), mild increase (40%; mean ABMI, 6.0 kg/m2), moderate increase (18%; mean
      ΔBMI, 10.8 kg/m2), and major increase (6%; mean ΔBMI, 15.5 kg/m2). Trajectories
      of greater BMI increase were associated with lower adjusted e′ velocity and
      higher E/e′ ratio compared with the stable BMI group, independent of year 0 or
      year 25 BMI. Participants in increasing BMI trajectory groups compared with the
      stable BMI group had lower absolute longitudinal strain and greater odds of
      diastolic dysfunction, independent of year 0 BMI but not year 25 BMI. Similar
      patterns were observed for change in waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio
      trajectory groups. Conclusions:: Steeper trajectories of BMI increase from young 
      adulthood to middle age, a vulnerable period for weight gain, are independently
      associated with lower E/e′ velocity and higher E/e′ ratio, but not systolic
      dysfunction, in midlife. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2018;■:■-■.)

      Measure(s): : Athletic trainers collected time-loss (≥24 hours) injury and
      exposure data. Injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), injury rate ratios 
      (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), injury proportions by body site, and 
      diagnoses were calculated. Results: : The High School Reporting Information
      Online system documented 3242 time-loss injuries during 1 393 753 AEs; the
      National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program documented
      5092 time-loss injuries during 772 048 AEs. Injury rates were higher in college
      than in high school (6.60 versus 2.33/1000 AEs; IRR = 2.84; 95% CI = 2.71, 2.96),
      and during competitions than during practices in high school (IRR = 4.88; 95% CI 
      = 4.54, 5.26) and college (IRR = 2.93; 95% CI = 2.77, 3.10). Most injuries at
      both levels affected the lower extremity and were ligament sprains or
      muscle/tendon strains. Concussions accounted for 24.5% of competition injuries in
      high school but 14.6% of competition injuries in college. More than one-third of 
      competition injuries to high school goalkeepers were concussions. Conclusions: : 
      Injury rates were higher in college versus high school and during competitions
      versus practices. These differences may be attributable to differences in
      reporting, activity intensity, and game-play skill level. The high incidence of
      lower extremity injuries and concussions in girls' and women's soccer,
      particularly concussions in high school goalkeepers, merits further exploration
      and identification of prevention strategies.

TI  - Epidemiology of Injuries Requiring Emergency Transport Among Collegiate and High 
      School Student-Athletes.
PG  - 906-14
AB  - Context: : Data regarding the epidemiology of emergency-transport incidents
      (ETIs) of patients with sport-related injuries are lacking. Understanding the use
      of emergency services by athletic trainers can help improve emergency
      preparedness and prehospital care for injured student-athletes. Objective: : To
      determine the frequencies and types of ETIs resulting from athletic
      participation. Design: : Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: : Participating
      colleges and high schools during 2009–2010 to 2014–2015 and 2011–2012 to
      2013–2014, respectively. Patients or Other Participants: : Student-athletes in 23
      high school and 25 intercollegiate sports. Main Outcome Measure(s): : Data on
      injuries requiring emergency transport were collected by each team's athletic
      trainer via their respective online injury-tracking software. Athletic trainers
      also collected data on athlete-exposures (AEs). Emergency-transport incident
      frequencies and injury rates per 10 000 AEs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
      were reported. For each ETI, the sport, body part, injury mechanism, and final
      diagnosis were recorded. Results: : A total of 339 and 146 ETIs were reported in 
      collegiate and high school players, respectively. Collegiate women's ice hockey
      had the highest ETI rate (1.28/10 000 AEs; 95% CI = 0.71, 1.86). In high school, 
      football had the highest rate at 0.80 per 10 000 AEs (95% CI = 0.64, 0.97).
      Athletes with head or face injuries required the most transports in college (n = 
      71, 20.9%) and high school (n = 33, 22.6%) across all sports. Strains (n = 50,
      14.7%) and fractures (n = 35, 24.0%) were the leading diagnoses for patients
      undergoing transport in college and high school, respectively. Conclusions: :
      Athletic trainers should maintain a high level of emergency preparedness when
      working with sports that have high rates and numbers of ETIs. Athletes with
      injuries to the head/face required the most frequent transport across competition
      levels. Athletic trainers should have the appropriate equipment and protocols in 
      place to handle these patients. Future researchers should examine the differences
      between field and hospital diagnoses to help improve prehospital care and
      decrease the likelihood of unnecessary emergency transports.

      Through 2013–2014).
PG  - 893-905
AB  - Context: : The advent of Web-based sports injury surveillance via programs such
      as the High School Reporting Information Online system and the National
      Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program has aided the
      acquisition of boys' and men's soccer injury data. Objective: : To describe the
      epidemiology of injuries sustained in high school boys' soccer in the 2005–2006
      through 2013–2014 academic years and collegiate men's soccer in the 2004–2005
      through 2013–2014 academic years using Web-based sports injury surveillance.
      Design: : Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: : Online injury surveillance
      from soccer teams of high school boys (annual average = 100) and collegiate men
      (annual average = 41). Patients or Other Participants: : Boys' or men's soccer
      players who participated in practices and competitions during the 2005–2006
      through 2013–2014 academic years in high school and the 2004–2005 through
      2013–2014 academic years in college, respectively. Main Outcome Measure(s): :
      Athletic trainers collected time-loss (≥24 hours) injury and exposure data.
      Injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), injury rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs), and injury proportions by body site and diagnosis
      were calculated. Results: : High School Reporting Information Online documented
      2912 time-loss injuries during 1 592 238 AEs; the National Collegiate Athletic
      Association Injury Surveillance Program documented 4765 time-loss injuries during
      686 918 AEs. The injury rate was higher in college than in high school (6.94
      versus 1.83/1000 AEs; IRR = 3.79; 95% CI = 3.62, 3.97). Injury rates increased
      with smaller school size for high schools and were higher in Division I than in
      Divisions II and III. The injury rate was higher during competitions than during 
      practices in both high school (IRR = 3.55; 95% CI = 3.30, 3.83) and college (IRR 
      = 3.45; 95% CI = 3.26, 3.65). Most injuries were to the lower extremity. However,
      concussion was a common injury, particularly in collegiate goalkeepers and at all
      positions for high school players. Concussions accounted for more than one-fifth 
      of injuries in high school games. Conclusions: : Injury-prevention interventions 
      should be tailored to reflect variations in the incidence and type of injury by
      level of competition, event type, and position.

TI  - Does partner selection mediate the relationship between school attendance and
      HIV/HSV-2 among adolescent girls and young women in South Africa: An analysis of 
      HPTN 068 data.
PG  - 20-7
AB  - Objective: School attendance prevents HIV and HSV-2 in adolescent girls and young
      women (AGYW) but the mechanisms to explain this relationship remain unclear. Our 
      study assesses the extent to which characteristics of sex partners, partner age
      and number, mediate the relationship between attendance and risk of infection in 
      AGYW in South Africa. Design: We use longitudinal data from the HPTN 068
      randomized controlled trial in rural South Africa where girls were enrolled in
      early adolescence and followed in the main trial for over three years. We
      examined older partners and number of partners as possible mediators. Methods: We
      use the parametric g-formula to estimate 4-year risk differences for the effect
      of school attendance on cumulative incidence of HIV/HSV-2 overall and the
      controlled direct effect (CDE) for mediation. We examined mediation separately
      and jointly for the mediators of interest. Results: We found that young women
      with high attendance in school had a lower cumulative incidence of HIV compared
      to those with low attendance (risk difference=-1.6%). Partner age difference
      (CDE=-1.2%) and number of partners (CDE=-0.4%) mediated a large portion of this
      effect. In fact, when we accounted for the mediators jointly, the effect of
      schooling on HIV was almost removed showing full mediation (CDE= −0.3%). The same
      patterns were observed for the relationship between school attendance and
      cumulative incidence of HSV-2 infection. Conclusion: Increasing school attendance
      reduces risk of acquiring HIV and HSV-2. Our results indicate the importance of
      school attendance in reducing partner number and partner age difference in this
      relationship.

TI  - Socioeconomic Vulnerability and Sexually Transmitted Infection among Pregnant
      Haitian Women.
PG  - 626-31
AB  - Background: Despite evidence that education and poverty act through distinct
      pathways to influence sexually transmitted infection (STI), few studies have
      examined the unique, independent associations of these socioeconomic
      vulnerabilities on sexual risk behaviors and STI among women. Methods: From
      August-October 2013, women at an antenatal clinic in Gressier, Haiti, were
      interviewed and tested for Chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis
      (N=200). We measured low educational attainment as <9 years of schooling and
      currently living in poverty based on crowding, defined as >2 people sleeping in
      one room. We used logistic regression to estimate independent associations
      between each socioeconomic indicator and outcomes of sexual behaviors and STI.
      Results: Approximately 29% of the sample had a current STI (chlamydia: 8.0%;
      gonorrhea: 3.0%; trichomoniasis: 20.5%), with 2.5% testing positive for more than
      one STI. Forty percent of the sample reported low educational attainment and 40% 
      reported current poverty. Low educational attainment was associated with early
      risk behaviors, including twice the odds of earlier sexual debut (adjusted OR
      (AOR): 2.09, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.84). Poverty was associated with reporting the
      current main sexual partner to be non-monogamous (AOR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.00, 4.01) 
      and current STI (AOR=2.50, 95% CI: 1.26, 4.98). Conclusion: Education and poverty
      appear to independently influence STI behaviors and infection, with low education
      associated with early sexual risk and poverty associated with current risk and
      infection. Improving women’s educational attainment may be important in improving
      risk awareness, thereby reducing risky sexual behaviors and preventing a
      trajectory of STI risk.

TI  - Structural network position and performance of health leaders within an HIV
      prevention trial.
PG  - 3033-43
AB  - The effectiveness of peer leaders in promoting health may depend on the position 
      they occupy within their social networks. Using sociocentric (whole network) and 
      behavioral data from the intervention arm of a cluster-randomized HIV prevention 
      trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we used generalized linear models with
      standardized predictors to examine the association between heath leaders’
      baseline structural network position (i.e., in-degree and betweenness centrality)
      and their 12-month self-reported 1) confidence in educating network members about
      HIV and gender-based violence (GBV) and 2) number of past-week conversations
      about HIV and GBV. As in-degree centrality increased, leaders reported fewer
      HIV-related conversations. As betweenness centrality increased, leaders reported 
      greater number of conversations about GBV. Network position was not significantly
      associated with confidence in discussing either topic. Our results suggest that
      peer leaders who occupy spaces between subgroups of network members may be more
      effective in engaging their peers in sensitive or controversial topics like GBV
      than more popular peer leaders.

TI  - Estimating the impact of changes to occupational standards for silica exposure on
      lung cancer mortality.
PG  - 658-65
AB  - Background: Respiratory exposure to silica is associated with the risk of death
      due to malignant and non-malignant disease. 2.3 million U.S. workers are exposed 
      to silica. Occupational exposure limits for silica are derived from a number of
      lines of evidence, including observational studies. Observational studies may be 
      subject to healthy worker survivor bias, which could result in underestimates of 
      silica’s impact on worker mortality and, in turn, bias risk estimates for
      occupational exposure limits. Methods: Using data on 65,999 workers pooled across
      multiple industries, we estimate the impacts of several hypothetical occupational
      exposure limits on silica exposure on lung cancer and all-cause mortality. We use
      the parametric g-formula, which can account for healthy worker survivor bias.
      Results: Assuming we could eliminate occupational exposure, we estimate that
      there would be 20.7 fewer deaths per 1,000 workers in our pooled study by age 80 
      (95% confidence interval: 14.5, 26.8), including 3.91 fewer deaths due to lung
      cancer (95%CI: 1.53, 6.30). Less restrictive interventions demonstrated smaller, 
      but still substantial risk reductions. Conclusions: Our results suggest that
      occupational exposure limits for silica can be further strengthened to reduce
      silica-associated mortality and illustrate how current risk analysis for
      occupational limits can be improved.

TI  - Relationship between QRS Duration and Incident Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 84-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: QRS duration (QRSd), a measure of ventricular conduction, has been
      associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but its relationship with
      incident atrial fibrillation (AF) is poorly understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: This
      study included 15,314 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
      (ARIC) study who were free of AF at baseline. QRSd was automatically measured
      from resting 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) at baseline. Incident AF cases
      were systematically ascertained using ECGs, hospital discharge diagnoses and
      death certificates. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression analyses were performed
      to investigate the relationship between QRSd and incident AF. Mean age of our
      population was 54±6 years (55% females). During a median follow-up of 21.2 years,
      2,041 confirmed incident AF cases occurred. In multivariable adjusted Cox models,
      a 1-SD increase in QRSd was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) (95%CI) for AF of
      1.05 (1.01;1.10), p=0.01. This relationship was significant among women (HR per
      1-SD increase in QRSd (95%CI) 1.13 (1.06; 1.20), p<0.001), but not among men
      (1.00 (0.95; 1.06), p=0.97) (p for interaction 0.005). Compared to individuals
      with a QRSd <100ms, the HRs for incident AF in individuals with a QRSd of 100–119
      and ≥120ms were 1.13 (1.02; 1.26) and 1.35 (1.08;1.68), respectively (p for trend
      0.002). Again, this relationship was significant among women (p for trend <0.001)
      but not among men (p for trend 0.23). CONCLUSION: In this large population-based 
      study, QRSd was an independent predictor of incident AF among women, but not in
      men. Further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Cognitive Precursors to Adolescents’ Reproductive Health: Exploring the Role of
      School-based Health Services.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - The goal of this study was to examine associations between the number of
      school-based health services (SBHS) provided and the cognitive precursors to
      adolescents’ reproductive health, including birth control self-efficacy,
      motivation to use birth control, attitudes toward birth control, and
      contraception knowledge. Further, this study examined whether these associations 
      varied by adolescents’ age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and
      race/ethnicity. Data were drawn from two waves of Add Health, a longitudinal
      survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents (1994–96).
      Results from hierarchical linear regression models indicated that the number of
      SBHS interacted with adolescents’ age to predict birth control self-efficacy,
      such that a greater number of SBHS were associated with greater birth control
      self-efficacy among 15-year-old adolescents. Findings also indicated that a
      greater number of SBHS were associated with lower reported birth control
      motivation. Although access to a greater number of health services in school
      settings had some effect, study findings suggest that simply increasing the
      number or range of health services provided may not be the most effective method 
      for supporting diverse adolescents’ reproductive health. This information is
      important for schools as it highlights the need for SBHS to be health outcome
      specific and can be used to inform initiatives related to adolescents’
      reproductive health.

TI  - Mother-Child Role Confusion, Child Adjustment Problems, and the Moderating Roles 
      of Child Temperament and Sex.
PG  - 1891-903
AB  - Role confusion is a deviation in the parent-child relationship such that a parent
      looks to a child to meet the parent’s emotional needs and abdicates, in part, the
      parental role in exchange for care, intimacy, or peer support from the child. In 
      addition, a child may initiate role-confused behavior in order to gain closeness 
      to a parent who is otherwise preoccupied by his or her own needs. The current
      study examined associations between mother-child role confusion at age 5 (coded
      role confusion from recorded free-play mother-child interactions) and teacher
      reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and peer problems, at grade 
      1. The sample (N = 557) is from a longitudinal study of families in rural
      communities, the Family Life Project (FLP). Mother-child role confusion predicted
      internalizing symptoms and peer problems (but not externalizing symptoms) above
      and beyond other dimensions of maternal parenting (sensitivity and harsh
      intrusiveness), demographic factors, and prior levels of outcome variables.
      However, some effect sizes were small, making replication desirable. Temperament 
      and child sex were important moderators: girls with difficult temperaments and
      boys with easy temperaments were more vulnerable to internalizing symptoms (but
      not externalizing symptoms or peer problems) in the context of role confusion. We
      discuss the singular importance of role confusion, a construct that has been
      largely unrecognized by developmental psychologists until recently, for
      behavioral outcomes of children as they transition into middle childhood.

TI  - Neighborhood language isolation and depressive symptoms among elderly US Latinos.
PG  - 774-82
AB  - Purpose:: Neighborhood segregation related to cultural factors, such as language 
      use, may influence elderly Latino depression. We examined the association between
      neighborhood-level Spanish language segregation and individual depressive
      symptoms among elderly Latinos. Methods:: We linked US Census language use data
      with geocoded population-based data from 1,789 elderly Latinos (mean age=70.6
      years) participating in the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (1998–2008).
      Neighborhood language segregation was measured with the Index of Concentration at
      the Extremes, which demonstrates the extent to which residents are concentrated
      at extremes of deprivation and privilege. We fit two-level generalized linear
      mixed models with random intercepts for census tracts to quantify the association
      between neighborhood-level language segregation and depressive symptoms,
      adjusting for identified confounders. Results:: After adjusting for age, sex, and
      nativity, residents of highly segregated Spanish-speaking neighborhoods had more 
      depressive symptoms than those in highly segregated English-only speaking
      neighborhoods (β=−4.410; 95% confidence interval [CI]=−6.851−−1.970). This
      association was largely attenuated upon adjustment for individual-level education
      (β=−2.119; 95% CI=−4.650–0.413). Conclusions:: Linguistically segregated
      communities may benefit from targeted outreach given the high depression
      prevalence in these neighborhoods. Further, our findings suggest that limited
      access to fundamental social protections, such as education, may drive the
      segregation-depression association among US Latinos.

TI  - Outcomes of infants receiving chronic peritoneal dialysis: an analysis of the
      USRDS registry.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - Background: Outcome data for infants on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) is
      limited and has been based primarily on the analyses of voluntary entry registry 
      data. In contrast, the United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) collects data on 
      all infants with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on chronic dialysis in the USA. 
      We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of this population and to
      determine the associated patient mortality. Methods: The USRDS database was
      reviewed retrospectively for data on infants who initiated CPD at ≤ 12 months of 
      age from 1990 to 2014. Infants were categorized into four groups, CPD initiation 
      age (≤ 1 month of age or neonates and > 1–12 months of age or older infants) and 
      initiation era (1990–1999 and 2000–2014). Results: A total of 1723 infants (574
      neonates and 1149 older infants) were identified. Overall, 20.9% of infants (147 
      neonates and 213 older infants) died on dialysis during the follow-up. The most
      commonly identified causes of death on dialysis were cardiorespiratory disease
      (25.8%) and infection (22.8%). There was an increased risk for mortality in all
      infants who initiated CPD in the earlier initiation era (1990–1999) vs the later 
      era (2000–2014) (aHR of 1.95), for females vs males (aHR 1.43), and for those
      with a primary diagnosis of cystic kidney diseases vs congenital anomalies of the
      kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) (aHR 1.84). In 2000–2014, patient survival at 1 
      and 5 years was 86.8% and 74.6% for those who initiated CPD as neonates and 89.6%
      and 79.3% for those who did so as older infants. Conclusions: In this large
      cohort of infants who received chronic peritoneal dialysis over more than two
      decades, the probability of survival after initiating CPD in the first year of
      life has significantly improved. There is no difference in the probability of
      death for neonates compared to older infants. However, the mortality rate remains
      substantial in association with multiple risk factors.

TI  - Evidence of Chronic Allograft Injury in Liver Biopsies From Long-term Pediatric
      Recipients of Liver Transplants.
PG  - 1838-1851.e7
AB  - Background and Aim:: A substantial proportion of pediatric liver transplant
      recipients develop subclinical chronic allograft injury. We studied whether there
      are distinct patterns of injury based on histopathology features and identified
      associated immunological profiles. Methods:: We conducted a cross-sectional study
      of 157 stable, long-term pediatric recipients of transplanted livers (70 boys;
      less than 6 years old; mean 8.9±3.46 years after liver transplant) who underwent 
      liver biopsy analysis from August 13, 2012 through May 1, 2014. Subjects received
      livers from a living or deceased donor and had normal results from liver tests
      for more than 4 years after receiving transplant. Liver biopsies were scored by a
      central pathologist; an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of histologic 
      features was used to sort biopsies into 3 clusters. We conducted transcriptional 
      and cytometric analyses of liver tissue samples and performed a systems biology
      analysis that incorporated clinical, serologic, histologic, and transcriptional
      data. Results:: The mean level of alanine aminotransferase in subjects was
      27.6±14.57 U/L and the mean level of gamma-glutamyl transferase was 17.4±7.93
      U/L. Cluster 1 was characterized by interface activity (n=34), cluster 2 was
      characterized by periportal or perivenular fibrosis without interface activity
      (n=45), and cluster 3 had neither feature (n=78). We identified a module of genes
      whose expression correlated with levels of alanine aminotransferase, class II
      donor-specific antibody, portal inflammation, interface activity, perivenular
      inflammation, portal and perivenular fibrosis, and cluster assignment. The module
      was enriched in genes that regulate T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) of liver and
      other transplanted organs. Functional pathway analysis revealed
      over-representation of TCMR gene sets for cluster 1 but not clusters 2 or 3.
      Conclusion:: In an analysis of biopsies from an apparently homogeneous group of
      stable, long-term pediatric liver transplant recipients with consistently normal 
      results from liver tests, we found evidence of chronic graft injury (inflammation
      and/or fibrosis). Biopsies with interface activity had a gene expression pattern 
      associated with TCMR.

TI  - Total cardiovascular events analysis of the EXAMINE trial in patients with type 2
      diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome.
PG  - 1022-7
AB  - Alogliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of 
      patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). EXAMINE was a randomized controlled
      clinical trial designed to demonstrate the cardiovascular (CV) safety of
      alogliptin. In the trial, 5380 patients with established T2DM who had a recent
      acute coronary syndrome event (between 15 and 90 days) were randomized to
      treatment with either alogliptin or placebo. To better understand and describe
      the CV safety of alogliptin, we analyzed data from the EXAMINE trial to determine
      whether treatment with alogliptin affected recurrent and total CV events. Poisson
      regression analysis compared the total number of occurrences of CV death, MI,
      stroke, unstable angina, and coronary revascularization between all patients
      randomized to alogliptin vs placebo groups. Patients with recurrent CV events
      were older and more likely to have renal disease and history of heart failure.
      There were 1100 first CV events and an additional 666 recurrent events over a
      median of 18 months of follow‐up. There were no significant differences with
      regard to total number of events in patients treated with alogliptin (n = 873) or
      placebo (n = 893; P = 0.52). Furthermore, there were no differences in the types 
      of events seen in patients treated with alogliptin or placebo. Alogliptin did not
      increase the risk of either first or recurrent CV events when compared with
      placebo in patients with T2DM and recent acute coronary syndrome. These data
      support the CV safety of alogliptin in patients who are at increased risk of
      future CV events.

TI  - Renal function and blood pressure are altered in adolescents born preterm.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - Background:: Preterm birth increases the risk of hypertension and kidney disease.
      However, it is unclear when changes in blood pressure (BP) and renal function
      become apparent and what role obesity and sex play. We hypothesized adolescents
      born preterm have higher BP and worse kidney function compared to term in an
      obesity- and sex-dependent manner. Methods:: Cross-sectional analysis of
      14-year-olds born preterm with very low birth weight (n=96) compared to term
      (n=43). We used generalized linear models to estimate the associations among
      preterm birth and BP, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and ln(x)
      urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), stratified by overweight/obesity (OWO,
      body mass index (BMI) ≥85th percentile) and sex. Results:: Compared to term,
      preterm-born adolescents had higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic
      blood pressure (DBP) (adjusted β (aβ): 3.5 mmHg, 95% CI -0.1 to 7.2 and 3.6 mmHg,
      95% CI 0.1 to 7.0), lower eGFR (β: -8.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI -15.9 to -0.4),
      and higher ACR (aβ: 0.34, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.72). OWO modified the preterm-term
      difference in DBP (BMI <85th percentile aβ: 5.0 mmHg, 95% CI 0.7 to 9.2 vs. OWO
      0.2 mmHg, 95% CI -5.3 to 5.6) and ACR (OWO aβ: 0.72, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.29 vs. BMI 
      <85th percentile 0.17, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.65). Sex modified the preterm-term ACR
      difference (female aβ: 0.52, 95% CI 0.001 to 1.04 vs. male 0.18, 95% CI -0.36 to 
      0.72). Conclusions:: Prematurity was associated with higher BP and reduced renal 
      function that were detectable in adolescence. OWO and sex may modify the strength
      of these relationships.

TI  - Quantum changes in self-efficacy and condom-use intention among youth: A chained 
      cusp catastrophe model.
PG  - 187-97
AB  - Introduction:: The complex relationships among HIV knowledge, condom-use skills, 
      self-efficacy, peer influence and intention to use condoms have been rigorously
      investigated. However, studies guided by a linear behavior change model often
      explain only a limited amount of variances. This study aims to advance our
      understanding of the relationships through a nonlinear quantum change paradigm.
      Methods:: Data (n=1970, 40.61% male, mean age 16.94±0.74) from a behavioral
      intervention program among high school students in the Bahamas were analyzed with
      a chained cusp catastrophe model in two steps. In the first step, self-efficacy
      was analyzed as the outcome with HIV knowledge/condom-use skills as asymmetry
      variables and peer influence as bifurcation variable. In the second step,
      condom-use intention was analyzed as the outcome while self-efficacy (outcome in 
      the first step) was used as bifurcation variable allowing peer influence as
      bifurcation, and HIV knowledge/condom-use skills were included as asymmetry. Cusp
      modeling analysis was conducted along with equivalent linear models. Results::
      The cusp model performed better than the linear and logistic models. Cusp
      modeling analyses revealed that peer influence significantly bifurcated the
      relationships between HIV knowledge/condom-use skills and self-efficacy; while
      both self-efficacy and peer influence significantly bifurcated the relationship
      between HIV knowledge/condom-use skills and condom-use intention. Conclusion::
      Our findings support the central role of self-efficacy and peer influence as two 
      chains in bridging the complex quantum relationships between HIV
      knowledge/condom-use skills and condom-use intention among adolescents. The
      nonlinear cusp catastrophe modeling provided a new method to advance HIV
      behavioral research.

TI  - Mobile Technology Use and Skills Among Individuals with Fragile X Syndrome:
      Implications For Healthcare Decision Making.
PG  - 821-32
AB  - Background.Little is known about how individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS)
      and their families use technology in daily life and what skills individuals with 
      FXS can perform when using mobile technologies. Methods.Using a mixed-methods
      design, including an online survey of parents (n = 198) and a skills assessment
      of individuals with FXS (n = 6), we examined the experiences and abilities of
      individuals with FXS for engaging with mobile technology. Results.Parents
      reported that individuals with FXS often used technology in their daily lives,
      with variations based on age of child, sex, autism status, depression, and
      overall ability. Parents frequently sought and shared FXS-related information
      online. Assessment data revealed that individuals with FXS demonstrated
      proficiency in interacting with technology. Conclusions.Mobile technology is a
      tool that can be used in FXS to build skills and increase independence rather
      than simply for recreational purposes. Implications for using mobile technology
      to enhance healthcare decision making are discussed.

TI  - Influences of heatwave, rainfall, and tree cover on cholera in Bangladesh.
PG  - 304-11
AB  - Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease and remains a global threat to public
      health. Climate change and variability have the potential to increase the
      distribution and magnitude of cholera outbreaks. However, the effect of heatwave 
      on the occurrence of cholera at individual level is still unclear. It is also
      unknown whether the local vegetation could potentially mitigate the effects of
      extreme heat on cholera outbreaks. In this study, we designed a case-crossover
      study to examine the association between the risk of cholera and heatwaves as
      well as the modification effects of rainfall and tree cover. The study was
      conducted in Matlab, a cholera endemic area of rural Bangladesh, where cholera
      case data were collected between January 1983 and April 2009. The association
      between the risk of cholera and heatwaves was examined using conditional logistic
      regression models. The results showed that there was a higher risk of cholera two
      days after heatwaves (OR=l.53, 95% CI: 1.07 – 2.19) during wet days (rainfall>0
      mm). For households with less medium-dense tree cover, the heatwave after a 2-day
      lag was positively associated (OR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.01– 3.22) with the risk of
      cholera during wet days. However, for households with more medium-dense tree
      cover, the association between the risk of cholera and heatwave in 2-day lag was 
      not significant. These findings suggest that heatwaves might promote the
      occurrence of cholera, while this relationship was modified by rainfall and tree 
      cover. Further investigations are needed to explore major mechanisms underlying
      the association between heatwaves and cholera as well as the beneficial effects
      of tree cover.

TI  - Receipt of adjuvant endometrial cancer treatment according to race: An NRG
      Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group 210 Study.
PG  - 459.e1-459.e11
AB  - Background:: Black women with endometrial cancer are more likely to die from
      their disease compared to white women with endometrial cancer. These survival
      disparities persist even when disproportionately worse tumor characteristics
      among black women are accounted. Receipt of less complete adjuvant treatment
      among black endometrial cancer patients could contribute to this disparity.
      Objective:: We assessed the hypothesis that black women with endometrial cancer
      are less likely than their white counterparts to receive adjuvant treatment
      within subgroups defined by tumor characteristics in the NRG Oncology/Gynecology 
      Oncology Group 210 Study. Study design:: Our analysis included 615 black and
      4,283 white women with endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy. Women
      completed a questionnaire that assessed race and endometrial cancer risk factors.
      Tumor characteristics were available from pathology reports and central review.
      We categorized women as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk based on the European
      Society for Medical Oncology definition. Adjuvant treatment was documented during
      postoperative visits and was categorized as no adjuvant treatment (54.3%),
      radiotherapy only (16.5%), chemotherapy only (15.2%), and radiotherapy plus
      chemotherapy (14.0%). We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds
      ratios and 95% confidence intervals for multivariable-adjusted associations
      between race and adjuvant treatment in the overall study population and
      stratified by tumor subtype, stage, or European Society for Medical Oncology risk
      category. Results:: Overall, black women were more likely to have received
      chemotherapy-only (odds ratio=1.40, 95% confidence interval=1.04-1.86) or
      radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (odds ratio=2.01, 95% confidence
      interval=1.54-2.62) compared to white women in multivariable-adjusted models. No 
      racial difference in receipt of radiotherapy-only was observed. In tumor
      subtype-stratified models, black women had higher odds of receiving radiotherapy 
      plus chemotherapy than white women when diagnosed with low-grade endometrioid
      (odds ratio=2.04, 95% confidence interval=1.06-3.93) or serous tumors (odds
      ratio=1.81, 95% confidence interval=1.07-3.08). Race was not associated with
      adjuvant treatment among women diagnosed with other tumor subtypes. In
      stage-stratified models we observed no racial differences in receipt of adjuvant 
      treatment. In models stratified by European Society for Medical Oncology risk
      group, black women with high-risk cancer were more likely to receive radiotherapy
      plus chemotherapy compared to white women (odds ratio=1.41, 95% confidence
      interval=1.03-1.94). Conclusion:: Contrary to our hypothesis we observed higher
      odds of specific adjuvant treatment regimens among black as compared to white
      women within specific subgroups of endometrial cancer characteristics.

      cardiovascular protective effects in preclinical models of ischemic
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), and genetic polymorphisms in EPHX2 have been
      associated with developing ischemic CVD in humans. However, it remains unknown
      whether EPHX2 variants are associated with prognosis following an ischemic CVD
      event. We evaluated the association between EPHX2 p.Lys55Arg and p.Arg287Gln
      genotype with survival in 667 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. No
      association with p.Arg287Gln genotype was observed (P=0.598). Caucasian EPHX2
      Arg55 carriers (Lys/Arg or Arg/Arg) had a significantly higher risk of 5-year
      mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.01–2.55, P=0.045). In an independent population of 2,712 ACS patients, this
      association was not replicated (adjusted HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70–1.21, P=0.559). In 
      a secondary analysis, Caucasian homozygous Arg55 allele carriers (Arg/Arg)
      appeared to exhibit a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 2.60, 
      95% CI 1.09–6.17). These results demonstrate that EPHX2 p.Lys55Arg and
      p.Arg287Gln polymorphisms do not significantly modify survival after an ACS
      event. Investigation of other sEH metabolism biomarkers in ischemic CVD appears
      warranted.

TI  - Phenotypic Characterization of Eosinophilic Esophagitis in a Large Multi-Center
      Patient Population from the Consortium for Food Allergy Research.
PG  - 1534-1544.e5
AB  - Background: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is increasingly common, but data on
      phenotypic aspects are still incomplete. Objectives: To describe the clinical,
      endoscopic and histopathological features of a large number of children and
      adults with EoE across the US. Methods: This was a multi-site single visit
      registry enrolling subjects aged 6 months-65 years with EoE. Participants
      provided responses regarding their medical history, with verification of the
      diagnosis and history by the study teams. Results: 705 subjects were analyzed
      (median [IQR] age at enrollment 11.2 [6.7–17.7] years, 68.2% male, 87.9% whites).
      67 subjects had concurrent gastrointestinal eosinophilia, with gastric mucosa
      most common. An age and race-dependent time gap was present between symptom onset
      and time of diagnosis (adults and whites with longer gap). Food allergy and
      atopic dermatitis were associated with a decrease in this gap. Symptoms varied
      with age (more dysphagia and food impaction in adults) and with race (more
      vomiting in non-whites). Esophageal rings and strictures at diagnosis were more
      common in adults, although esophageal eosinophilia was comparable among age
      groups. Concomitant allergic disease (91%), infectious/immunological disorders
      (44%), neurodevelopmental disorders (30%) and failure to thrive (21%) were
      common. Depression/anxiety increased with age. EoE was reported in 3% of parents 
      and 4.5% of siblings. Conclusions: Gastrointestinal eosinophilia is present in
      ~10% of EoE patients; the symptom-diagnosis time gap is influenced by age, race, 
      food allergy and atopic dermatitis; symptoms vary with race; concurrent
      infectious/immunological disorders and mental health disorders are common; and
      the level of esophageal eosinophils is comparable in patients with and without
      fibrostenotic features.

TI  - The Flexible Lifestyles Empowering Change (FLEX) Intervention for Adolescents
      with Type 1 Diabetes: Randomized Clinical Trial Results for Effect on Metabolic
      Status, Diabetes Related Behaviors, and Quality of Life.
PG  - 635-46
AB  - Background: Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) commonly have poor glycemic
      control. We aimed to test the efficacy of the Flexible Lifestyles Empowering
      Change (FLEX) adaptive behavioral intervention on primary (HbA1c) and secondary
      (psychosocial and metabolic) outcomes at 18 months. Methods: Youth (13–16 years, 
      T1D duration > 1 yr, and HbA1c of 64–119 mmol/mol [8∙0–13∙0%]) from two clinical 
      sites were eligible. FLEX used motivational interviewing and problem solving
      skills training to enhance self-management. Intervention fidelity was assessed
      via audiotaped sessions. Intent-to-treat analyses used mixed effects models, with
      fixed effects including site, timepoint, intervention group, intervention by
      timepoint, and baseline level of primary (HbA1c) or secondary outcomes
      (alpha=0∙05). Findings: Youth recruited from 05/01/2014 to 04/04/2016 were
      randomized to FLEX (n=130) or usual care control (n=128). Mean (SD) diabetes
      duration was 6∙4 (3∙8) years, and 71% used insulin pump therapy. Retention was
      93∙4%. Intervention fidelity score was 4∙4/5 for motivational interviewing and
      97∙4% for session content. At 18 months, HbA1c was not statistically
      significantly different between intervention [baseline: 82 (17) mmol/mol;
      follow-up: 83 (18)] and control [baseline: 80 (14); follow-up: 82 (17)]; change
      in intervention vs. control = −0∙7, 95% CI (−4∙7, 3∙4), p=0∙75. The intervention 
      was associated with improved scores for motivation (p=0∙009), problem solving
      (p=0∙04), diabetes self-management profile (p=0∙01), youth report of overall
      quality of life (p=0∙01), selected domains related to fear of hypoglycemia
      (p<0∙05), parent report of diabetes family conflict (p<0∙0001), total cholesterol
      (p=0∙04), and diastolic blood pressure (p=0∙01). Interpretation: The FLEX
      intervention did not significantly change HbA1c among these adolescents with
      elevated HbA1c, but did positively impact several psychosocial outcomes over 18
      months. Further analyses will reveal information regarding drivers of positive
      response to intervention and will point to future directions for improvement in
      the approach. Funding: NIH/NIDDK UC4DK101132 (MPIs: Mayer-Davis, Maahs, Seid) and

TI  - RIP2 Promotes House Dust Mite-induced Allergic Airway Inflammation.
PG  - 447-59
AB  - House dust mites are one of the most significant environmental allergens in the
      establishment of the so-called “Atopic March”. It is known that the immune
      response to HDM is Th2 dominant, but the innate mechanisms leading to HDM-induced
      type 2 responses are still not completely understood. A number of innate immune
      receptors have been implicated in the response to HDM including Toll-Like
      Receptors, C-type Lectin Receptors, and Protease Activated Receptors. NOD2 is a
      member of the NOD-Like Receptor family which has been reported to be involved in 
      the establishment of type 2 immunity and in blocking respiratory tolerance. NOD2 
      mediates its effects through its downstream effector kinase, RIP2. It has not
      been shown if RIP2 is involved in the innate response to HDM and in the resulting
      generation of type 2 immunity. Furthermore, the role of RIP2 in modulating
      allergic airway inflammation has been controversial. In this study, we show that 
      RIP2 is activated in airway epithelial cells in response to HDM and is important 
      for the production of CCL2. Using a murine HDM asthma model, we demonstrate that 
      lung pathology, local airway inflammation, inflammatory cytokines, HDM-specific
      IgG1 antibody production, and HDM-specific Th2 responses are all reduced in RIP2 
      KO mice compared to WT animals. These data illustrate that RIP2 can be activated 
      by a relevant allergic stimulus and that such activation can contribute to
      allergic airway inflammation. These findings also suggest that RIP2 inhibitors
      might have some efficacy in downregulating the inflammatory response in type
      2–dominated diseases.

TI  - Competence in Endoscopic Ultrasound and Endoscopic Retrograde
      Cholangiopancreatography, From Training Through Independent Practice.
PG  - 1483-1494.e7
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS:: It is unclear whether participation in competency-based
      fellowship programs for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) results in high-quality care in independent
      practice. We measured quality indicator (QI) adherence during the first year of
      independent practice among physicians who completed endoscopic training with a
      systematic assessment of competence. METHODS:: We performed a prospective
      multicenter cohort study of invited participants from 62 training programs. In
      phase 1, 24 advanced endoscopy trainees (AETs), from 20 programs, were assessed
      using a validated competence assessment tool. We used a comprehensive data
      collection and reporting system to create learning curves using cumulative sum
      analysis that were shared with AETs and trainers quarterly. In phase 2,
      participating AETs entered data into a database pertaining to every EUS and ERCP 
      examination during their first year of independent practice, anchored by key QIs.
      RESULTS:: By the end of training, most AETs had achieved overall technical
      competence (EUS 91.7%, ERCP 73.9%) and cognitive competence (EUS 91.7%, ERCP
      94.1%). In phase 2 of the study, 22 AETs (91.6%) participated and completed a
      median of 136 EUS examinations per AET and 116 ERCP examinations per AET. Most
      AETs met the performance thresholds for QIs in EUS (including 94.4% diagnostic
      rate of adequate samples and 83.8% diagnostic yield of malignancy in pancreatic
      masses) and ERCP (94.9% overall cannulation rate). CONCLUSIONS:: In this
      prospective multicenter study, we found that although competence cannot be
      confirmed for all AETs at the end of training, most meet QI thresholds for EUS
      and ERCP at the end of their first year of independent practice. This finding
      affirms the effectiveness of training programs. Clinicaltrials.gov ID
      NCT02509416.

TI  - Proinflammatory diet is associated with increased risk of squamous cell head and 
      neck cancer.
PG  - 1604-10
AB  - Diets high in fruits and vegetables and low in red meat intake have been
      associated with decreased risk of head and neck cancer. Additionally, chronic
      inflammation pathways and their association with cancer have been widely
      described. We hypothesized a pro-inflammatory diet, as measured by the Dietary
      Inflammatory Index (DII®), is associated with increased risk of head and neck
      cancer. We used the Carolina Head and Neck Cancer (CHANCE) study, a
      population-based case-control study of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
      Cases were recruited from a 46-county region in central North Carolina. Controls,
      frequency-matched on age, race, and sex, were identified through the North
      Carolina Department of Motor Vehicle records. The DII score, adjusted for energy 
      using the density approach (E-DII), was calculated from a food frequency
      questionnaire and split into four quartiles based on the distribution among
      controls. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated with unconditional logistic
      regression. Cases had higher E-DII scores (i.e., a more pro-inflammatory diet)
      compared with controls (Mean: −0.14 versus −1.50; p-value <0.001). When compared 
      with the lowest quartile, the OR for the highest quartile was 2.91 (95%
      confidence interval (CI): 2.16-3.95), followed by 1.93 (95% CI: 1.43-2.62) for
      the 3rd quartile, and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.00-1.89) for the 2nd quartile. Both alcohol
      and smoking had a significant additive interaction with E-DII (smoking relative
      excess risk due to interaction (RERI): 2.83; 95% CI: 1.36-4.30 and alcohol RERI: 
      1.75; 95% CI: 0.77-2.75). These results provide additional evidence for the
      association between pro-inflammatory diet and head and neck cancer.

TI  - Rotavirus Vaccination and Short-term Risk of Adverse Events in US Infants.
PG  - 448-57
AB  - Background: To evaluate the short-term risk of adverse events associated with
      rotavirus vaccine (RV) in infants, overall and by vaccine formulation (3-dose
      pentavalent, RV5; 2-dose monovalent, RV1). Methods: We identified US newborns
      with commercial insurance during 2006-2014 receiving a
      diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTaP) dose and assessed if RV was
      administered concurrently. We followed infants for 30 days after each dose for
      diagnoses of intussusception, other gastrointestinal events, seizures, Kawasaki
      disease, thrombocytopenia, otitis media, all-cause emergency department visits,
      and all-cause hospitalizations. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI) with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models
      comparing: (i) those receiving DTaP+RV versus those receiving DTaP alone; and
      (ii) RV5 versus RV1. Analyses were performed separately within DTaP doses and
      then meta-analysed across doses. Results: We identified 1,031,431 first DTaP
      doses, 821,833 second doses, and 615,293 third doses; 79.2% had a concurrent RV, 
      94.1% of which were RV5. Absolute risks of serious outcomes were very low.
      Compared to infants who received DTaP alone, infants who received RV+DTaP did not
      experience consistently increased risk of intussusception (hazard ratio [HR]
      1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.88) or any other outcome except for
      otitis media after dose 2: HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08-1.15. This increased otitis media
      risk was not as pronounced in RV5 when comparing RV5 to RV1; HR 0.92, 95% CI
      0.89-0.95. Conclusions: These data were not consistent with an increased risk of 
      intussusception or other adverse events following vaccination with RV, except
      potentially for a small increased risk of otitis media, particularly in RV1.

TI  - Consequences of Involvement in Distinct Patterns of Adolescent Peer and Dating
      Violence.
PG  - 2371-83
AB  - Typological theoretical perspectives suggest that the consequences of involvement
      in peer and dating violence may depend on the particular pattern of violent
      behaviors that youth experience and/or engage in. Yet few studies have examined
      whether distinct patterns of dating and peer violence involvement differentially 
      predict developmental outcomes. Using two waves of data, the current study
      examined the prospective associations between distinct patterns of peer and
      dating aggression and victimization, identified using latent class analysis, and 
      a range of potential developmental outcomes in a general population sample of
      adolescents in the 8th to 10th grades (n=3068; 46% female, 58% White, 31% Black, 
      11% other race/ethnicity). The findings suggest that, compared to youth involved 
      in other patterns of violence, youth involved in peer and dating violence as
      aggressors and victims are at greatest risk for negative sequelae, although
      results differed considerably for girls and boys and on the outcome variable and 
      comparison groups being examined.

TI  - Albuminuria and Allograft Failure, Cardiovascular Disease Events, and All-Cause
      Death in Stable Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Cohort Analysis of the FAVORIT
      Trial.
PG  - 51-61
AB  - Rationale and Objective:: Cardiovascular disease is common and overall graft
      survival suboptimal among kidney transplant recipients. While albuminuria is a
      known risk factor for adverse outcomes among persons with native chronic kidney
      disease, the relationship of albuminuria with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes 
      in transplant recipients is uncertain. Study Design:: Post-hoc, longitudinal
      cohort analysis of the Folic Acid for Vascular Outcomes Reduction in
      Transplantation (FAVORIT) Trial Setting and Participants:: Stable kidney
      transplant recipients with elevated homocysteine level from 30 sites in the
      United States, Canada and Brazil Predictor:: Urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR)
      at randomization. Outcomes:: Allograft failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and
      all-cause death. Analytical Approach:: Multivariable Cox models adjusted for age,
      sex, race, randomized treatment allocation, country, systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure, history of CVD, diabetes and hypertension, smoking, cholesterol, body
      mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), donor type, transplant
      vintage, medications, and immunosuppression. Results:: Among 3,511 participants
      with complete data, median ACR was 24 (Q1-Q3, 9–98) mg/g, mean eGFR 49 ± 18
      (standard deviation) ml/min/1.73m2, mean age 52 ± 9 years, and median graft
      vintage 4.1 (Q1-Q3, 1.7–7.4) years. There were 1017 (29%) with ACR <10 mg/g, 912 
      (26%) with 10–29 mg/g, 1,134 (32%) with 30–299 mg/g, and 448 (13%) with ACR ≥300 
      mg/g. Over approximately 4 years, 282 allograft failure events, 497 CVD events,
      and 407 deaths occurred. Event rates were higher at both lower eGFR and higher
      ACR. ACR of 30–299 and ≥300 mg/g relative to ACR <10 mg/g were independently
      associated with graft failure [HRs of 3.40 (95% CI, 2.19–5.30) and 9.96 (95% CI, 
      6.35–15.62), respectively], CVD events [HRs of 1.25 (95% CI, 0.96–1.61) and 1.55 
      (95% CI, 1.13–2.11), respectively], and all-cause death [HRs of 1.65 (95% CI,
      1.23–2.21) and 2.07 (95% CI, 1.46–2.94), respectively]. Limitations:: No data on 
      rejection; single ACR assessment Conclusion:: In a large population of stable
      kidney transplant recipients, elevated baseline ACR is independently associated
      with allograft failure, CVD, and death. Future studies are needed to evaluate
      whether reducing albuminuria improves these outcomes.

TI  - Risk of Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome After Autotransplants
      for Lymphomas and Plasma Cell Myeloma.
PG  - 130-6
AB  - Background: Exposures to DNA-damaging drugs and ionizing radiations increase
      risks of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
      Methods: 9,028 recipients of hematopoietic cell autotransplants (1995–2010) for
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL; n=916), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n=3546) and plasma cell 
      myeloma (PCM; n=4566), reported to the CIBMTR, were analyzed for risk of
      subsequent AML or MDS. Results: 335 MDS/AML cases were diagnosed posttransplant
      (3.7%). Variables associated with an increased risk for AML or MDS in
      multivariate analyses were: (1) conditioning with total body radiation versus
      chemotherapy alone for HL (HR=4.0; 95% confidence interval [1.4, 11.6]) and NHL
      (HR=2.5 [1.1, 2.5]); (2) ≥3 versus 1 line of chemotherapy for NHL (HR=1.9 [1.3,
      2.8]); and (3) subjects with NHL transplanted in 2005–2010 versus 1995–1999
      (HR=2.1[1.5,3.1]).UsingSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, we
      found risks for AML/MDS in HL, NHL and PCM to be 5–10 times the background rate. 
      In contrast, relative risks were 10–50 for AML and approximately 100 for MDS in
      the autotransplant cohort. Conclusions: There are substantial risks of AML and
      MDS after autotransplants for HL, NHL and PCM.

TI  - Perceptions of family decision-makers of nursing home residents with advanced
      dementia regarding the quality of communication around end-of-life care.
PG  - 879-83
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (1) Compare family decision-makers’ perceptions of quality of
      communication with nursing home (NH) staff (nurses and social workers) and
      clinicians (physicians and other advanced practitioners) for persons with
      advanced dementia; (2) determine the extent to which characteristics of NH
      residents and family decision-makers are associated with those perceptions.
      DESIGN: Secondary analysis of baseline data from a cluster randomized trial of
      the Goals of Care intervention. SETTING: Twenty-two NHs in North Carolina.
      PARTICIPANTS: Family decision-makers of NH residents with advanced dementia
      (N=302). MEASUREMENTS: During the baseline interviews, family decision-makers
      rated the quality of general communication and communication specific to
      end-of-life care using the Quality of Communication Questionnaire (QoC). QoC item
      scores ranged 0 – 10, with higher scores indicating better quality of
      communication. Linear models were used to compare QoC by NH provider type, and to
      test for associations of QoC with resident and family characteristics. RESULTS:
      Family decision-makers rated the QoC with NH staff higher than NH clinicians,
      including average overall QoC scores [5.5 (1.7) vs. 3.7 (3.0), p<0.001], general 
      communication subscale scores [8.4 (1.7) vs. 5.6 (4.3), p<0.001], and end-of-life
      communication subscale scores [3.0 (2.3) vs. 2.0 (2.5), p<0.001]. Low scores
      reflected failure to communicate about many aspects of care, particularly
      end-of-life care. QoC scores were higher with later stage dementia, but were not 
      associated with the age, gender, race, relationship to the resident, or
      educational attainment of family decision-makers. CONCLUSION: Although family
      decision-makers for persons with advanced dementia rated quality communication
      with NH staff higher than that with clinicians, they reported poor quality
      end-of-life communication for both staff and clinicians. Clinicians simply did
      not perform many communication behaviors that contribute to high quality
      end-of-life communication. These omissions suggest opportunities to clarify and
      improve interdisciplinary roles in end-of-life communication for residents with
      advanced dementia.

TI  - Effect of antiretroviral therapy on allele-associated Lp(a) level in women with
      HIV in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study[S].
PG  - 1967-76
AB  - We previously demonstrated an association between lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels 
      and atherosclerosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive women. The
      effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on Lp(a) levels in relation to apo(a)
      size polymorphism remain unclear. ART effects on allele-specific apo(a) level
      (ASL), an Lp(a) level associated with individual apo(a) alleles within each
      allele-pair, were determined in 126 HIV-seropositive women. ART effects were
      tested by a mixed-effects model across pre-ART and post-ART first and third
      visits. Data from 120 HIV-seronegative women were used. The mean age was 38
      years; most were African-American (∼70%). Pre-ART ASLs associated with the larger
      (4.6 mg/dl vs. 8.0 mg/dl, P = 0.024) or smaller (13 mg/dl vs. 19 mg/dl, P =
      0.041) apo(a) sizes were lower in the HIV-seropositive versus HIV-seronegative
      group, as was the prevalence of a high Lp(a) level (P = 0.013). Post-ART ASL and 
      prevalence of high Lp(a) or apo(a) sizes and frequency of small size apo(a) (≤22 
      kringles) did not differ between the two groups. ART increased Lp(a) level (from 
      18 to 24 mg/dl, P < 0.0001) and both ASLs (P < 0.001). In conclusion, regardless 
      of genetic control, Lp(a) can be modulated by HIV and its treatment. ART
      initiation abrogates HIV-induced suppression of Lp(a) levels and ASLs,
      contributing to promote CVD risk in HIV-seropositive individuals.

TI  - Preconceptional cardiovascular health and pregnancy outcomes in women with
      systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 70-7
AB  - Objective: To estimate the effects of preconceptional cardiovascular health,
      measured by American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, on pregnancy outcomes in
      women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: The study included
      patients in the Hopkins Lupus Pregnancy Cohort. Body mass index (BMI), total
      cholesterol, and blood pressure in the most recent clinic visit prior to
      conception or 1st trimester were used to determine cardiovascular health (ideal, 
      intermediate or poor health) based on AHA definitions. Outcomes included preterm 
      birth, gestational age at birth, and small for gestational age (SGA).
      Multivariable linear and logistic regression models with generalized estimating
      equations estimated the association of each cardiovascular health factor and
      outcome. Results: The analysis included 309 live births. There were 95 preterm
      births (31%), and of the 293 pregnancies with birth weights, 18% were SGA. Ideal 
      BMI, total cholesterol and blood pressure were reported in 56%, 85%, and 51% of
      pregnancies, respectively. Intermediate BMI was associated with decreased odds of
      SGA (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.63), adjusted for race and prednisone use.
      Intermediate/poor total cholesterol was associated with increased odds of preterm
      birth (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.06, 4.62). Intermediate/poor blood pressure was
      associated with decreased gestational age at birth (β: −0.96; 95% CI: −1.62,
      −0.29). Conclusion: Poor/intermediate preconception cardiovascular health affects
      pregnancy outcomes of preterm birth and SGA infants among women with SLE. Efforts
      to maintain BMI, total cholesterol, and blood pressure within the recommended
      ideal range prior to pregnancy is important in order to improve pregnancy
      outcomes in women with SLE.

TI  - Suicide rates among patients with cancers of the digestive system.
PG  - 2274-80
AB  - Objective:: Previous studies have suggested that suicide rates are elevated among
      cancer patients relative to the general population. In this analysis, we
      comprehensively evaluated characteristics associated with higher suicide rates
      among patients with cancers of the digestive system. Methods:: Using the United
      States (U.S.) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we
      identified all patients diagnosed with digestive system cancers during 2000–2014.
      Patients were classified as having died from suicide if their cause of death in
      SEER was listed as “suicide and self-inflicted injury.” Suicide rates were
      compared to age-, sex-, and race-adjusted rates in the general population.
      Results:: A total of 881 suicides were identified among 856,293 patients
      diagnosed with digestive system cancers. The suicide rate in this population was 
      32.8 per 100,000 person-years, and was nearly twice that in the general
      population (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]=1.91; 95% CI: 1.79, 2.04). Suicide
      rates were significantly elevated for all cancer sites, but were highest for
      esophageal (SMR=5.03), pancreatic (SMR=5.28), stomach (SMR=2.84), and liver
      (SMR=2.14) cancers. SMRs for suicide were highest within the first five years of 
      diagnosis, and increased with age at diagnosis for all sites except colon and
      stomach. Conclusions:: Patients with cancers of the digestive system have a
      higher incidence of suicide than the general population. Suicide rates among
      esophageal and pancreatic cancer patients are more than five times general
      population rates. The involvement of psychiatrists and other mental health
      professionals may be a critical component of cancer care for these high-risk
      patient subgroups.

TI  - The First Decade of Web-Based Sports Injury Surveillance: Descriptive
      Epidemiology of Injuries in US High School Girls' Field Hockey (2008–2009 Through
      2013–2014) and National Collegiate Athletic Association Women's Field Hockey
      (2004–2005 Through 2013–2014).
PG  - 938-49
AB  - Context: : The advent of Web-based sports injury surveillance via programs such
      as the High School Reporting Information Online system and the National
      Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program has aided the
      acquisition of data for girls' and women's field hockey injuries. Objective: : To
      describe the epidemiology of injuries sustained in high school girls' field
      hockey in the 2008–2009 through 2013–2014 academic years and collegiate women's
      field hockey in the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 academic years using Web-based
      sports injury surveillance. Design: : Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: : 
      Online injury surveillance from field hockey teams in high school girls (annual
      average = 61) and collegiate women (annual average = 14). Patients or Other
      Participants: : Girls' and women's field hockey players who participated in
      practices and competitions during the 2008–2009 through 2013–2014 high school
      academic years and the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 collegiate academic years.
      Main Outcome Measure(s): : Athletic trainers collected time-loss (≥24 hours)
      injury and exposure data. Injury rates per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), injury
      rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and injury proportions by
      body site and diagnosis were calculated. Results: : The High School Reporting
      Information Online system documented 983 time-loss injuries during 569 551 AEs;
      the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program
      documented 996 time-loss injuries during 185 984 AEs. The injury rate from
      2008–2009 through 2013–2014 was higher in college than in high school (3.25
      versus 1.73/1000 AEs; IRR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.63, 2.18). Most injuries occurred
      during practices in high school (52.0%) and college (60.7%). Injury rates were
      higher during competitions than practices in high school (IRR = 2.00; 95% CI =
      1.76, 2.26) and college (IRR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.73, 2.23). At both levels,
      injuries most commonly occurred to the lower extremity and head/face and resulted
      in muscle/tendon strains and contusions. However, injury patterns varied between 
      practices and competitions. Conclusions: : Injury rates and patterns varied
      across age groups and between practices and competitions, highlighting the need
      for development of targeted injury-prevention strategies at both levels of play.

TI  - FSEM: Functional Structural Equation Models for Twin Functional Data.
PG  - 344-57
AB  - The aim of this paper is to develop a novel class of functional structural
      equation models (FSEMs) for dissecting functional genetic and environmental
      effects on twin functional data, while characterizing the varying association
      between functional data and covariates of interest. We propose a three-stage
      estimation procedure to estimate varying coefficient functions for various
      covariates (e.g., gender) as well as three covariance operators for the genetic
      and environmental effects. We develop an inference procedure based on weighted
      likelihood ratio statistics to test the genetic/environmental effect at either a 
      fixed location or a compact region. We also systematically carry out the
      theoretical analysis of the estimated varying functions, the weighted likelihood 
      ratio statistics, and the estimated covariance operators. We conduct extensive
      Monte Carlo simulations to examine the finite-sample performance of the
      estimation and inference procedures. We apply the proposed FSEM to quantify the
      degree of genetic and environmental effects on twin white-matter tracts obtained 
      from the UNC early brain development study.

TI  - Sleep Disordered Breathing and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 in the Hispanic
      Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.
PG  - 278-84
AB  - Preclinical data suggest that hypoxia stimulates fibroblast growth factor 23
      (FGF23) transcription and cleavage in osteocytes, resulting in elevated
      circulating c-terminal (cFGF23) levels but normal intact FGF23 (iFGF23) levels.
      We conducted a case-control study within the Hispanic Community Health
      Study/Study of Latinos to investigate whether sleep disordered breathing, as a
      model of hypoxemia, is independently associated with elevated cFGF23 levels in
      the general population and with elevated cFGF23 and iFGF23 levels in patients
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in whom FGF23 cleavage may be impaired. Cases 
      (n=602) had severe sleep disordered breathing defined as an apnea/hypopnea index 
      (AHI) of ≥ 30. Controls without severe sleep disordered breathing (n=602) were
      matched for sex and CKD stage. The median AHI in the cases was 45.8 (IQR 35.5 –
      62.5) compared to 2.6 (IQR 0.6 – 8.2) in the controls. Cases had higher cFGF23
      levels than controls (66.2 RU/ml, IQR 52.8–98.4 vs. 61.2 RU/ml, IQR 49.5–80.1, p 
      value < 0.001). There were no differences in iFGF23 levels between cases and
      controls. In adjusted linear regression and multinomial regression analyses, body
      mass index attenuated the relationship between severe sleep disordered breathing 
      and cFGF23 levels. No significant relationships were seen in analyses of severe
      sleep disordered breathing and iFGF23 levels or in analyses of iFGF23 and cFGF23 
      stratified by CKD status. Additional studies using other models of intermittent
      and chronic hypoxia are needed to confirm whether hypoxia stimulates FGF23
      transcription in humans and to determine the impact on iFGF23 levels in CKD.

TI  - Longitudinal Changes in Symptom Cluster Membership in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 473-81
AB  - Purpose: To describe changes in symptom cluster membership over 1 year and to
      examine which demographic and clinical factors predict changes in symptom cluster
      membership among adults with inflammatory bowel disease. Design: A retrospective 
      longitudinal study of the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America Partners Cohort
      from 2012 to 2015. Methods: We measured symptoms of pain interference, fatigue,
      sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. We used latent transition analysis to
      describe changes in symptom cluster membership (baseline, 6 months, and 12
      months) and multinomial regressions to examine factors associated with symptom
      cluster membership transition. Findings: Four groups were identified (N = 5,296):
      high symptom burden (32.3%–35.3%), low symptom burden (24.2%–27.1%), physical
      symptoms (19.0%–20.9%; pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance), and psychological
      symptoms (20.0%–21.5%; depression, anxiety). The probability of staying in the
      same group was .814 to .905. Moving from active disease into remission was
      associated with moving from the high burden to low burden and psychological
      symptom groups. Conclusions: Symptom cluster membership was quite stable over 1
      year. Research is needed to understand the underlying etiology of symptom
      clusters better and to develop interventions to reduce symptom burden in this
      vulnerable population. Clinical Relevance: Careful consideration of symptom
      management options should be done with patients to select options that are
      effective and potentially target multiple symptoms.

TI  - Harmonization of Respiratory Data From 9 US Population-Based Cohorts: The NHLBI
      Pooled Cohorts Study.
PG  - 2265-78
AB  - Chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRDs) are the fourth leading cause of death 
      in the United States. To support investigations into CLRD risk determinants and
      new approaches to primary prevention, we aimed to harmonize and pool respiratory 
      data from US general population-based cohorts. Data were obtained from
      prospective cohorts that performed prebronchodilator spirometry and were
      harmonized following 2005 ATS/ERS standards. In cohorts conducting follow-up for 
      noncardiovascular events, CLRD events were defined as hospitalizations/deaths
      adjudicated as CLRD-related or assigned relevant administrative codes. Coding and
      variable names were applied uniformly. The pooled sample included 65,251 adults
      in 9 cohorts followed-up for CLRD-related mortality over 653,380 person-years
      during 1983–2016. Average baseline age was 52 years; 56% were female; 49% were
      never-smokers; and racial/ethnic composition was 44% white, 22% black, 28%
      Hispanic/Latino, and 5% American Indian. Over 96% had complete data on smoking,
      clinical CLRD diagnoses, and dyspnea. After excluding invalid spirometry
      examinations (13%), there were 105,696 valid examinations (median, 2 per
      participant). Of 29,351 participants followed for CLRD hospitalizations, median
      follow-up was 14 years; only 5% were lost to follow-up at 10 years. The NHLBI
      Pooled Cohorts Study provides a harmonization standard applied to a large, US
      population-based sample that may be used to advance epidemiologic research on
      CLRD.

TI  - Methotrexate is not superior to placebo in maintaining steroid-free response or
      remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1098-1108.e9
AB  - Background & Aims: Parenteral methotrexate induces clinical remission but not
      endoscopic improvement of mucosal inflammation in patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC). We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the
      efficacy of parenteral methotrexate in maintaining steroid-free response or
      remission in patients with UC following induction therapy with methotrexate and
      steroids. Methods: We performed a 48-week trial, from February 2012 through May
      2016, of 179 patients with active UC (Mayo score 6–12 with endoscopy subscore ≥2)
      despite previous conventional or biological therapy. The study comprised a
      16-week open-label methotrexate induction period followed by a 32-week
      double-blind placebo-controlled maintenance period. Patients were given
      subcutaneous methotrexate (25 mg/week) and a 12-week steroid taper. At week 16,
      steroid-free responders were randomly assigned to groups that either continued
      methotrexate (25 mg/week, n=44) or were given placebo (n=40) until week 48. We
      compared the efficacy of treatment by analyzing the proportion of patients who
      remained relapse free and were in remission at week 48 without use of steroids or
      other medications to control disease activity. Results: Ninety-one patients (51%)
      achieved response at week 16, and 84 patients were included in the maintenance
      period study. During this period, 60% of patients in the placebo group (24/40)
      and 66% in the methotrexate group (29/44) had a relapse of UC (P=.75). At week
      48, 30% of patients in the placebo group (12/40) and 27% of patients in the
      methotrexate group (12/44) were in steroid-free clinical remission without need
      for additional therapies (P=.86). No new safety signals for methotrexate were
      detected. Conclusions: Parenteral methotrexate (25 mg/week) was not superior to
      placebo in preventing relapses of UC in patients who achieved steroid-free
      response during induction therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov ID no: NCT01393405

TI  - Microvascular Endothelial Function and Neurocognition among Adults with Major
      Depressive Disorder.
PG  - 1061-9
AB  - Background:: Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and endothelial dysfunction have
      been associated independently with poorer neurocognition in middle-age adults,
      particularly on tests of frontal-lobe function. However, to our knowledge, no
      studies have examined markers of microvascular dysfunction and neurocognition or 
      the potential interaction between macro and microvascular biomarkers on
      neurocognition. Therefore in a secondary analysis of a previously reported
      clinical trial, we examined this association in adults with major depressive
      disorder (MDD) in middle-aged and older adults. Methods:: Participants included
      202 adults with MDD and not receiving mental health treatment. Microvascular
      endothelial function was assessed using a non-invasive marker of forearm reactive
      hyperemia velocity while macrovascular endothelial function was assessed using
      flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. CVRFs were assessed using
      the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile and fasting lipid levels. A standardized
      neurocognitive assessment battery was used to assess three cognitive domains
      (Executive Function, Working Memory, and Verbal Memory). Results:: Greater
      microvascular dysfunction was associated with poorer neurocognition across all
      three domains. In multiple regression analyses, microvascular function continued 
      to predict Verbal Memory performance after accounting for background factors and 
      CVRFs. Macro and microvascular function interacted to predict Working Memory
      performance (F = 4.511, 178, P = .035), with a similar non-significant
      association for Executive Function (F = 2.731, 178, P = .095), with moderate
      associations observed between microvascular function and neurocognition in the
      presence of preserved FMD (r61 = 0.40, P = .001), but not when FMD was impaired
      (r63 = −0.05, P = .675). Conclusions:: Greater microvascular dysfunction is
      associated with poorer neurocognition among middle-aged and older adults. This
      association was strongest in participants with preserved macrovascular function, 
      suggesting that it may provide a sensitive correlate of neurocognition that is
      superseded by systemic vascular dysfunction.

TI  - Condom use intentions mediate the relationships between psychosocial constructs
      and HIV sexual risk behavior in young Black men who have sex with men.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - HIV prevention interventions that reduce sexual risk behaviors among young Black 
      men who have sex with men (YBMSM), the most severely affected population in the
      United States, are critical for reducing disparities in HIV infection. However,
      there are few theory-based sexual risk reduction interventions designed
      specifically for YBMSM. This study tested the applicability of the Integrated
      Behavioral Model (IBM), which theorizes that behavioral intentions mediate the
      relationship between psychosocial constructs and health behavior on condomless
      anal intercourse (CAI) among YBMSM. To test key constructs of the IBM, analyses
      were conducted with baseline data from the HealthMpowerment (HMP) randomized
      controlled trial. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships
      between condom use self-efficacy, norms, attitudes, intentions, and environmental
      constraints, and CAI. Mediation analysis was conducted to determine if condom use
      intentions mediated the relationship between psychosocial constructs (i.e.,
      condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes) and CAI. Overall 55.7% reported
      one or more acts of CAI with a male partner in the past 3 months. Those who
      reported CAI in the 3 months prior to the baseline survey reported lower
      self-efficacy for condom use, lower condom use norms, more negative attitudes
      toward condom use, and lower condom use intentions at baseline than those who
      reported no CAI. In mediation analysis, the relationships between CAI and
      self-efficacy for condom use (estimated indirect effect=−0.004 (SE=0.002)),
      condom use norms (−0.002 (SE=0.001)) and attitudes toward condom use (−0.005
      (SE=0.002)) were mediated by condom use intentions. This study applied the IBM to
      sexual risk behavior among a sample of YBMSM. Results indicate that the
      relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes, and CAI
      were mediated by condom use intentions. Future theory-informed interventions
      should focus on increasing self-efficacy for condom use, condom use norms,
      attitudes toward condom use, and condom use intentions to reduce CAI among YBMSM.

TI  - Objectively Measured Sedentary Behavior, Physical Activity, and Cardiometabolic
      Risk in Hispanic Youth: Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latino Youth.
PG  - 3289-98
AB  - Context: Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), but not in 
      sedentary behavior (SB), is related to cardiometabolic risk among non-Hispanic
      white youth. Objective: Examine associations of SB and MVPA with cardiometabolic 
      risk factors among Hispanic/Latino youth. Design: Cross-sectional analysis.
      Setting: Four US communities. Participants: Hispanic/Latino youth (N = 1,426)
      ages 8 to 16 years. Measurements: Associations of MVPA and SB, measured using
      7-day accelerometer data (independent variables), with markers of glucose and
      lipid metabolism, inflammation, and endothelial function (dependent variables),
      were assessed in multivariable linear regression models while adjusting for
      sociodemographic characteristics and accelerometer wear time. Additional models
      controlled for obesity measures. Results: SB comprised a mean (SD) of 75% (13%)
      of accelerometer wear time; mean (SD) time of MVPA was 35 min/d (22 min/d).
      Deleterious levels of high-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (HDL-C),
      triglycerides, insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, and plasminogen activator 
      inhibitor-1 were associated with lower levels of MVPA and higher levels of SB
      (all P < 0.05). Associations of MVPA with log-transformed triglyceride
      concentrations (β per 15-min/d increment, −0.039; SE, 0.018; P = 0.037) and SB
      with HDL-C (β per 30-min/d increment, −0.63; SE, 0.26; P = 0.018), but not those 
      with other markers, remained significant after adjusting for MVPA or SB and
      further adjustment for body mass index and waist circumference. Higher SB
      tertiles were associated with lower soluble receptor for advanced glycation end
      products in fully adjusted models (P for trend = 0.037). Conclusions:
      Physiological precursors of diabetes and cardiovascular disease were associated
      with MVPA and SB among US Hispanic/Latino youth, a group that bears a
      disproportionate burden of metabolic disorders.

TI  - Prevalence and incidence of probable perinatal depression among women enrolled in
      Option B+ antenatal HIV care in Malawi.
PG  - 115-22
AB  - Background: Perinatal depression is a common condition of pregnancy and the
      postpartum period. Depression negatively affects engagement in HIV care, but
      systematic screening for perinatal depression is not done in most sub-Saharan
      African countries. Estimating the burden and timing of perinatal depression can
      help inform medical programs with the current scale-up of HIV care for pregnant
      women. Methods: Women (n=299) initiating antiretroviral therapy for HIV were
      recruited from a government antenatal clinic in Malawi in 2015-2016 into a cohort
      study. Probable perinatal depression was assessed at enrollment and at 6 weeks
      and 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 
      (EPDS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We estimated point prevalence 
      and incidence of depression as well as concordance between EPDS and PHQ-9 scores.
      Results: One in ten women screened positive for probable antenatal depression,
      whereas 1-6% screened positive postpartum. Sensitivity analyses to account for
      loss to follow-up suggested that postpartum depression prevalence could have
      ranged from 1-11%. At postpartum time points, 0-3% of participants screened
      positive for incident probable depression. EPDS and PHQ-9 scores were concordant 
      for 96% of assessments during antenatal and postpartum visits. Limitations: Lack 
      of diagnostic psychiatric evaluation precludes actual diagnosis of major
      depression, and social desirability bias may have contributed to low postpartum
      scores. Conclusions: Probable depression was more common during the antenatal
      period than postpartum among our participants. Given the association between
      depression and negative HIV outcomes, screening for depression during pregnancy
      should be integrated into antenatal HIV care.

TI  - Associations between chronic caregiving stress and T cell markers implicated in
      immunosenescence.
PG  - 546-9
AB  - Chronic psychological stress is associated with accelerated biological aging,
      immune dysfunction, and premature morbidity and mortality. Changes in the
      relative proportions of T cell subpopulations are thought to be a characteristic 
      of immunological aging; however, understanding of whether these changes are
      associated with chronic psychological stress is incomplete. This study
      investigated associations between chronic caregiving stress and distributions of 
      T cell phenotypes in a sample of high stress mothers of children with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder (caregivers; n=91) and low stress mothers of neurotypical
      children (controls; n=88). Immune markers assessed were naïve (CD45RA+CD62L+),
      central memory (CD45RA-CD62L+), and effector memory (CD45RA-CD62L-) CD4+ and CD8+
      T cells. We also examined the ratio of effector to naïve (E:N) CD4+ and CD8+ T
      cells. In models adjusted for age, body mass index, race/ethnicity, and
      antidepressant use, caregivers displayed higher percentages of effector memory
      CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as well as lower percentages of naïve CD8+ T cells and
      central memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells compared to controls. Caregivers also
      displayed significantly higher E:N ratios for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These
      findings were also independent of cytomegalovirus infection status. Furthermore, 
      higher parental stress, across both groups, was related to several immune
      parameters. These findings provide preliminary evidence that chronic parental
      caregiving stress is associated with changes in relative proportions of T cell
      subpopulations that are consistent with accelerated immunological aging.

TI  - Family History of MI, Smoking, and Risk of Periodontal Disease.
PG  - 1106-13
AB  - Periodontal disease (PD) shares common risk factors with cardiovascular disease. 
      Our hypothesis was that having a family history of myocardial infarction
      (FamHxMI) may be a novel risk factor for PD. Risk assessment based on FamHxMI,
      conditional on smoking status, was examined given the strong influence of smoking
      on PD. Exploratory analysis with inflammatory biomarkers and genetic determinants
      was conducted to understand potential mechanistic links. The Women’s Genome
      Health Study (WGHS) is a prospective cohort of US female health care
      professionals who provided blood samples at baseline in the Women’s Health Study,
      a 2 × 2 factorial clinical trial investigating vitamin E and aspirin in the
      prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. PD was ascertained via
      self-report over 12 y of follow-up. Prevalence (3,442 cases), incidence (1,365
      cases), and survival analysis of PD were investigated for associations of FamHxMI
      as well as in strata of FamHxMI by smoking. Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square tests,
      multivariate regression, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for the
      analyses. In the WGHS, women with FamHxMI showed higher risk of ever having PD. A
      particularly high-risk group of having both FamHxMI and smoking at baseline was
      highlighted in the prevalence and risk of developing PD. PD risk increased
      according to the following strata: no FamHxMI and nonsmokers (reference), FamHxMI
      and nonsmokers (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.5), smokers without
      FamHxMI (HR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.5), and smokers with FamHxMI (HR = 1.5, 95% 
      CI = 1.2 to 1.8). An independent analysis by the dental Atherosclerosis Risk in
      Communities study (N = 5,552) identified more severe periodontitis cases among
      participants in the high-risk group (smokers with FamHxMI). Further examination
      of interactions among inflammatory biomarkers or genetic exploration with FamHxMI
      did not explain the risk increase of PD associated with FamHxMI in the WGHS.
      Future efforts based on an integrative-omics approach may facilitate validation
      of these findings and suggest a mechanistic link between PD and FamHxMI.

PG  - 2862-70
AB  - Prospective identification of candidates for deferred therapy is not standardized
      and many patients receive immediate therapy regardless of risk. We conducted a
      retrospective, multi-center cohort analysis of MCL patients with comprehensive
      clinical data to examine the use and safety of deferred therapy for newly
      diagnosed patients. Previously untreated patients ≥ 18 years-old with MCL
      diagnosed in 1993–2015 at five academic sites were included. Of 395 patients, 72 
      (18%) received deferred therapy (defined as receipt of first treatment > 90 days 
      following initial diagnosis). Patients receiving deferred therapy were more
      likely to have an ECOG performance status of 0 (67% vs 44% p =0.001), have no B
      symptoms (83% vs 65% p=0.003) and have normal LDH levels at diagnosis (87% vs 55%
      p <0.001). In multivariable analysis, deferred therapy was not associated with a 
      significant difference in OS (HR 0.64: 95% CI 0.22–1.84, p=0.407).

TI  - Water Fluoridation and Dental Caries in U.S. Children and Adolescents.
PG  - 1122-8
AB  - Fluoridation of America’s drinking water was among the great public health
      achievements of the 20th century. Yet there is a paucity of studies from the past
      3 decades investigating its dental health benefits in the U.S. population. This
      cross-sectional study sought to evaluate associations between availability of
      community water fluoridation (CWF) and dental caries experience in the U.S. child
      and adolescent population. County-level estimates of the percentage of population
      served by CWF (% CWF) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Water
      Fluoridation Reporting System were merged with dental examination data from 10 y 
      of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999 to 2004 and 2011 to
      2014). Dental caries experience in the primary dentition (decayed and filled
      tooth surfaces [dfs]) was calculated for 7,000 children aged 2 to 8 y and in the 
      permanent dentition (decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces [DMFS]) for
      12,604 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 y. Linear regression models
      estimated associations between % CWF and dental caries experience with adjustment
      for sociodemographic characteristics: age, sex, race/ethnicity, rural-urban
      location, head-of-household education, and period since last dental visit.
      Sensitivity analysis excluded counties fluoridated after 1998. In unadjusted
      analysis, caries experience in the primary dentition was lower in counties with
      ≥75% CWF (mean dfs = 3.3; 95% confidence limit [CL] = 2.8, 3.7) than in counties 
      with <75% CWF (mean dfs = 4.6; 95% CL = 3.9, 5.4), a prevented fraction of 30%
      (95% CL = 11, 48). The difference was also statistically significant, although
      less pronounced, in the permanent dentition: mean DMFS (95% CL) was 2.2 (2.0,
      2.4) and 1.9 (1.8, 2.1), respectively, representing a prevented fraction of 12%
      (95% CL = 1, 23). Statistically significant associations likewise were seen when 
      % CWF was modeled as a continuum, and differences tended to increase in
      covariate-adjusted analysis and in sensitivity analysis. These findings confirm a
      substantial caries-preventive benefit of CWF for U.S. children and that the
      benefit is most pronounced in primary teeth.

TI  - Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring and Neurocognitive Function in Children with
      Primary Hypertension.
PG  - 1765-71
AB  - Background: Children with primary hypertension have been reported to have
      diminished scores in measures of cognition. However, little is known about the
      relative correlation between office and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and
      neurocognitive test performance, and whether short-term BP variability is
      associated with decreased neurocognitive function. We sought to determine whether
      ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was more strongly associated with neurocognitive 
      test performance compared with office BP, and whether increased short-term BP
      variability was associated with lower neurocognitive scores. Methods:
      Seventy-five subjects ages 10 – 18 y, with untreated primary hypertension and 75 
      matched normotensive controls completed neurocognitive testing. All subjects had 
      office BP and ABPM prior to neurocognitive testing. Results: On multivariate
      analyses, there was no significant association between office BP and
      neurocognitive tests. However, several ABPM parameters were significantly
      associated with neurocognitive test scores in the lower quartile, in particular
      24hr SBP load and wake SBP index [Rey Auditory Verbal learning Test (RAVLT) List 
      A Trial 1, 24hr SBP load, odds ratio (OR) = 1.02, wake SBP index, OR = 1.06; List
      A Total, 24hr SBP load, OR = 1.02, wake SBP index, OR = 1.06; Short delay recall,
      wake SBP index, OR = 1.06; CogState Maze delayed recall, 24hr SBP load, OR =
      1.03, wake SBP index, OR = 1.08; Grooved Pegboard, 24hr SBP load, OR = 1.02; all 
      p<0.05]. In contrast, short-term BP variability measures were not associated with
      neurocognitive test performance. Conclusion: ABPM is superior to office BP in
      distinguishing hypertensive youth with lower neurocognitive test performance.

TI  - Utility of Autopsy among Pediatric Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant 
      Recipients: One Last Chance to Learn?
PG  - 1861-5
AB  - Background: Autopsy may confirm clinical diagnoses or identify conditions that
      were not suspected prior to a patient’s death. Previous studies evaluating the
      utility of autopsy in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients
      yielded conflicting results. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study
      of children (<18 years of age) undergoing allogeneic HSCT at Duke University who 
      died of any cause between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2016. We evaluated
      associations between patient characteristics and autopsy performance using
      Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. We reviewed autopsy reports to determine the 
      concordance between pre-autopsy causes of death and pathological diagnoses
      identified on autopsy. We classified unexpected diagnoses on autopsy using
      criteria developed by Goldman et al. We evaluated for temporal changes in the
      autopsy consent rate and the frequency of unexpected diagnoses on autopsy using
      Cochran-Armitage tests. Results: During the 22-year study period, 475 patients
      died and had data available on autopsy performance, and 130 (27%) of these
      patients underwent autopsy. The autopsy consent rate declined over time
      (P<0.0001), with autopsies being performed for 40% of deaths in 1995-1999 and 17%
      of deaths in 2009-2016. White patients were more likely to undergo autopsy than
      non-white patients (P=0.03). There were no associations between autopsy
      performance and patient age, sex, HSCT indication, or HSCT donor. Unexpected
      diagnoses were identified in 31 (24%) autopsies. The proportion of autopsies with
      an unexpected diagnosis did not change during the study period (P=0.45). However,
      infectious diagnoses that would have led to a change in management were more
      frequently identified on autopsies in 1995-2003 than in 2004-2016 (20% vs. 0%,
      P=0.001). Conclusions: The autopsy consent rate for pediatric HSCT recipients at 
      our institution declined substantially over the past several decades. The utility
      of autopsy in this patient population remains high despite a reduction in the
      identification of unexpected infections.

TI  - Epstein–Barr Virus Antibody Titers Are Not Associated with Gastric Cancer Risk in
      East Asia.
PG  - 2765-72
AB  - Background: Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric cancers represent a
      distinct subtype of gastric cancers and account for nearly 10% of the gastric
      cancer burden, yet risk detection strategies for this cancer subtype are lacking.
      Methods: We conducted a nested case–control study where we assayed 4 EBV antigens
      [viral capsid antigen (VCA), early antigen (EA), Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen
      (EBNA), and BZLF1-encoded replication activator protein (ZEBRA)] in either sera
      or plasma from 1447 gastric cancer cases and 1797 controls obtained from seven
      prospective cohorts representing individuals from the high gastric cancer-risk
      countries of China, Japan, and Korea. Results: The prevalence of EBV
      sero-positivity was universal with the exception of one sero-negative individual,
      and the highest titers of the EBV antigens VCA (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78–1.17), EBNA 
      (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72–1.08), EA (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79–1.19), and ZEBRA (OR 0.87, 
      95% CI 0.71–1.07) were not associated with risk of incident gastric cancer. When 
      we stratified these data by H. pylori status, there was no change in the
      association. Conclusions: Multiplex serology of the aforementioned EBV antigens
      in serum may not be a suitable biomarker for predicting gastric cancer risk in
      East Asian populations.

TI  - The physical environment in family child care homes and children’s physical
      activity.
PG  - 746-52
AB  - Background: Family child care homes (FCCHs) are the second largest provider of
      child care in the United States, yet little is known about how this setting
      influences children’s physical activity, particularly related to the physical
      environment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine what aspects of the
      FCCH physical environment facilitate or hinder children’s physical activity.
      Methods: Data were collected from 166 FCCH providers and 496 preschool aged
      children in 2013–2014 as part of the Keys to Healthy FCCHs study. Children’s
      moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was measured using Actigraph GT3X+ 
      accelerometers. Wear data from the child care day were isolated and cut-points
      were applied in order to calculate children’s minutes of MVPA per hour.
      FCCH-level estimates of child MVPA per hour were calculated. Indoor and outdoor
      physical environment characteristics were assessed during a two-day observation
      using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) modified for
      FCCHs. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between
      indoor, portable play equipment, and outdoor FCCH physical environment
      characteristics and children’s MVPA per hour. Results: Only indoor play space was
      significantly associated with children’s MVPA (β=0.33; p=0.034), indicating that 
      when provided with more indoor space for active play, children were more
      physically active. No significant associations were noted between portable play
      equipment or the outdoor environment and children’s MVPA. Conclusions: Indoor
      space was the only physical environment characteristic associated with children’s
      MVPA, suggesting that teaching FCCH providers how to best utilize their indoor
      play space for active play may be a way to promote children’s physical activity. 
      Futures studies should explore the impact of other environmental characteristics 
      of the FCCH (e.g., provider practices and policies) on children’s physical
      activity.

TI  - Identification of Clonal Hematopoiesis Mutations in Solid Tumor Patients
      Undergoing Unpaired Next-Generation Sequencing Assays.
PG  - 5918-24
AB  - Purpose:: In this era of precision-based medicine, for optimal patient care,
      results reported from commercial next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays should
      adequately reflect the burden of somatic mutations in the tumor being sequenced. 
      Here, we sought to determine the prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis leading to
      possible misattribution of tumor mutation calls on unpaired Foundation Medicine
      NGS assays. Experimental Design:: This was a retrospective cohort study of
      individuals undergoing NGS of solid tumors from two large cancer centers. We
      identified and quantified mutations in genes known to be frequently altered in
      clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, ATM, CHEK2, SF3B1, CBL, JAK2)
      that were returned to physicians on clinical Foundation Medicine reports. For a
      subset of patients, we explored the frequency of true clonal hematopoiesis by
      comparing mutations on Foundation Medicine reports with matched blood sequencing.
      Results:: Mutations in genes that are frequently altered in clonal hematopoiesis 
      were identified in 65% (1,139/1,757) of patients undergoing NGS. When excluding
      TP53, which is often mutated in solid tumors, these events were still seen in 35%
      (619/1,757) of patients. Utilizing paired blood specimens, we were able to
      confirm that 8% (18/226) of mutations reported in these genes were true clonal
      hematopoiesis events. The majority of DNMT3A mutations (64%, 7/11) and minority
      of TP53 mutations (4%, 2/50) were clonal hematopoiesis. Conclusions:: Clonal
      hematopoiesis mutations are commonly reported on unpaired NGS testing. It is
      important to recognize clonal hematopoiesis as a possible cause of misattribution
      of mutation origin when applying NGS findings to a patient’s care.

TI  - Menstrual Cycle Characteristics as Determinants of Plasma Concentrations of
      Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa 
      Study).
PG  - 78-85
AB  - Introduction:: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are fluorinated organic
      compounds that have been used in a variety of industrial and consumer
      applications. Menstruation is implicated as a possible route of elimination for
      PFASs in women. The overall purpose of this study was to examine menstrual cycle 
      characteristics as determinants of plasma PFAS concentrations in women. Methods::
      Our study sample consisted of 1977 pregnant women from the Norwegian Mother and
      Child Cohort (MoBa) study. The women were asked about menstrual cycle regularity 
      in the year before the pregnancy and typical menstrual cycle length as well as
      other demographic and reproductive characteristics in a questionnaire completed
      during the pregnancy. Blood samples were collected around 17–18 weeks gestation
      and PFAS concentrations were measured in plasma. We examined the association
      between menstrual cycle characteristics and seven PFASs (perfluorooctanoic acid
      (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA),
      perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS),
      perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)) using
      multiple linear regression, adjusted for age, pre-pregnancy body mass index,
      smoking, education, income, parity, oral contraceptive use, inter-pregnancy
      interval, and breastfeeding duration. Results:: Irregular cycles were not
      associated with PFAS concentrations. Overall, we found no evidence of
      associations between menstrual cycle length and PFAS concentrations. In subgroup 
      analyses we found some evidence, among parous women, of decreased PFHpS and PFOS 
      with short menstrual cycles; we also found, among recent OC users (in the 12
      months before the questionnaire) increased PFNA and PFUnDA with long cycle
      length. Limitations of our study include misclassification of menstrual cycle
      characteristics, small sample sizes in the sub-group analyses, and a lack of
      information on duration and volume of menses. Conclusions:: In the entire study
      sample, we found little evidence of menstrual cycle characteristics as
      determinants of PFAS concentrations. However, we observed some associations
      between cycle length and PFAS concentrations with some select PFAS compounds in
      subgroup analyses.

TI  - Understanding Why Pictorial Cigarette Pack Warnings Increase Quit Attempts.
PG  - 232-43
AB  - Background: Our randomized trial found that pictorial cigarette pack warnings
      elicited more quit attempts than text-only warnings. Purpose: In the current
      study, we sought to identify psychological mechanisms that explain why pictorial 
      cigarette pack warnings change behavior. Methods: In 2014 and 2015, we recruited 
      2,149 adult smokers in NC and CA, USA. We randomly assigned smokers to receive on
      their cigarette packs for 4 weeks either a text-only warning (one of the USA’s
      current warnings on the side of cigarette packs) or a pictorial warning (one of
      the USA’s proposed text warnings with pictures on the top half of the front and
      back of cigarette packs). Results: Pictorial warnings increased attention to,
      reactions to, and social interactions about cigarette pack warnings (all p <
      .05). However, pictorial warnings changed almost no belief or attitude measures. 
      Mediators of the impact of pictorial warnings included increased attention,
      negative affect, social interactions, thinking about the warning and harms of
      smoking, and intentions to quit (all p < .05). Analyses also found that pictorial
      warnings led to greater avoidance of the warnings, which was associated with more
      quit attempts (p < .05). Conclusions: Pictorial warnings increased quit attempts 
      by eliciting aversive reactions and by keeping the message vividly in smokers’
      minds. Contrary to predictions from several theories of health behavior, the
      warnings exerted little of their influence through changes in beliefs and
      attitudes and none of their influence through changes in risk perception. We
      propose the Tobacco Warnings Model based on these findings. Clinical Trial

TI  - The Relationship between Self-reported Restless Sleep and Objectively Measured
      Physical Activity in Adults with Knee Osteoarthritis.
LID - 10.1002/acr.23581
AB  - Objective: Despite many health benefits of physical activity, inactivity is
      endemic among adults with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Because sleep quality may be
      a target to improve physical activity behavior, we investigated the
      cross-sectional relationship between restless sleep and physical activity in
      participants with or at risk for KOA. Methods: We analyzed accelerometer-measured
      physical activity and clinical data from Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)
      participants. We used multiple regression analysis to evaluate physical activity 
      for participants grouped by the reported frequency of restless sleep adjusting
      for demographic and medical confounders. Results: Of the 1892 OAI participants
      with complete data, 300 (16%) reported restless sleep 3 or more days in the past 
      week. Participants reporting much (3-4 days/week) and most (5-7 days/week)
      restless sleep had 11.9% and 23.7% less weekly minutes of moderate-vigorous
      activity, respectively, compared to participants reporting rare restless sleep
      (less than 1 day/week) (p for trend 0.021). These differences persisted after
      accounting for age, gender, race, body mass index, medical comorbidity, KOA
      severity and pain (p for trend 0.023). Differences related to restless sleep were
      largely attenuated by the presence of high depressive symptoms and low energy
      levels. Conclusion: Poor sleep quality is associated with less physical activity 
      in persons with or at risk for KOA. Future studies are needed to determine the
      mechanisms of how poor sleep and physical activity are related, how energy and
      depression mediate these relationships, and whether interventions that improve
      sleep quality might result in increased physical activity.

TI  - Identification of risk factors for toxicity in patients with hormone
      receptor-positive advanced breast cancer treated with bevacizumab plus letrozole:
      A CALGB 40503 (Alliance) correlative study.
PG  - 325-34
AB  - Background:: In hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, a
      progression-free survival benefit was reported with addition of bevacizumab to
      first-line letrozole. However, increased toxicity was observed. We hypothesized
      that functional age measures could be used to identify patients at risk for
      toxicity while receiving letrozole plus bevacizumab for hormone receptor-positive
      advanced breast cancer. Methods:: CALGB 40503 was a phase III trial that enrolled
      patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer randomized to
      letrozole with or without bevacizumab. Patients randomized to bevacizumab were
      approached to complete a validated assessment tool evaluating physical function, 
      comorbidity, cognition, psychological state, social support, and nutritional
      status. The relationship between pretreatment assessment measures and the
      incidence of grade ≥3 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
      Adverse Events Version 3.0) adverse events was determined. Results:: One hundred 
      thirteen (58%) of 195 patients treated with letrozole plus bevacizumab completed 
      the pretreatment assessment questionnaire. One patient was excluded due to
      missing adverse event data. The median age of patients was 56. Frequently
      reported grade ≥3 adverse events were hypertension (26%), pain (20%), and
      proteinuria (7%). Two hemorrhagic events (one grade 5) and 1 thrombosis event
      occurred. Age ≥65 years (p<0.01), decreased vision (p=0.04), and poorer
      pretreatment physical function measures (p<0.05) were found on univariate
      analysis to be significantly associated with increased incidence of grade ≥3
      adverse events. Upon multivariate analysis, age ≥65 years (p=0.01) and decreased 
      vision (p=0.04) remained significant. Univariable and multivariable logistic
      regression models demonstrated associations between age, vision, the ability to
      walk up flights of stairs, and grade ≥3 adverse events. Conclusions:: Age (≥65
      years), decreased vision, and impairments in physical function correlated with
      increased incidence of toxicity in patients receiving first-line letrozole plus
      bevacizumab. When evaluating therapy likely to increase toxicity, functional
      assessment measures can identify patients at increased risk for side effects who 
      may benefit from closer monitoring.

TI  - Factors associated with breast MRI use among women with a family history of
      breast cancer.
PG  - 764-71
AB  - Although annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for women 
      at high risk for breast cancer as an adjunct to screening mammography, breast MRI
      use remains low. We examined factors associated with breast MRI use in a cohort
      of women with a family history of breast cancer but no personal cancer history.
      Study participants came from the Sister Study cohort, a nationwide, prospective
      study of women with at least one sister who had been diagnosed with breast cancer
      but who themselves had not ever had breast cancer (n=17,894). Participants were
      surveyed on breast cancer beliefs, cancer worry, breast MRI use, provider
      communication, and genetic counseling and testing. Logistic regression was used
      to assess factors associated with having a breast MRI overall and for those at
      high risk. Breast MRI was reported by 16.1% and was more common among younger
      women and those with higher incomes. After adjustment for demographics, ever use 
      of breast MRI was associated with actual and perceived risk. Odds ratios (OR)
      were 12.29 (95% CI, 8.85–17.06), 2.48 (95% CI, 2.27–2.71) and 2.50 (95% CI,
      2.09–2.99) for positive BRCA1/2 test, lifetime breast cancer risk ≥ 20%, and
      being told by a health care provider of higher risk, respectively. Women who
      believed they had much higher risk than others or had higher level of worry were 
      twice as likely to have had breast MRI; OR=2.23 (95% CI, 1.82–2.75) and OR=1.76
      (95% CI, 1.52–2.04). Patterns were similar among women at high risk. Breast
      cancer risk, provider communication and personal beliefs were determinants of
      breast MRI use. To support shared decisions about the use of breast MRI, women
      could benefit from improved understanding of the chances of getting breast cancer
      and increased quality of provider communications.

TI  - HBV and HCV test uptake and correlates among men who have sex with men in China: 
      A nationwide cross-sectional online survey.
PG  - 502-7
AB  - Objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cause substantial
      morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including
      China. WHO guidelines recommend men who have sex with men (MSM) receive HBV and
      HCV screening. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of MSM
      in China who have HBV and HCV tested and identify correlates of test uptake.
      Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of young MSM in China.
      Respondents were asked to report previous HBV and HCV testing, sociodemographic
      information, sexual risk factors for hepatitis infection, other STI testing, and 
      primary care physician (PCP) status. Associations were analysed by logistic
      regression. Results: 503 eligible MSM completed the survey. 41.0% (206/503) of
      MSM had HCV tested, and 38.2% (60/157) of MSM with no or uncertain HBV
      vaccination had HBV tested. In multivariate analysis, HCV testing was correlated 
      with HBV testing (aOR 22.98, 12.11 – 43.60), HIV testing (aOR 3.64, 1.92 – 6.91),
      HIV-positive status (aOR 1.78, 1.07 – 2.98), and having a PCP (aOR 2.40, 1.44 –
      3.98). Among MSM with no or uncertain HBV vaccination, HBV testing was correlated
      with HCV testing (aOR 80.85, 20.80 – 314.33), HIV testing (aOR 5.26, 1.81 –
      15.28), HIV-positive status (aOR 3.00, 1.22 – 7.37), and having a PCP (aOR 2.69, 
      1.00 – 7.26). Conclusions: Our data suggest many young MSM in China have not
      received hepatitis testing. HCV testing rates were lower than those recently
      reported among MSM in Australia and the United States. The strong correlation
      between HBV and HCV testing suggests bundled testing interventions may be useful 
      for MSM in China. Men with a PCP were more likely to have received hepatitis
      testing, consistent with literature demonstrating the importance of primary care 
      in expanding access to testing.

TI  - Lack of Difference in Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes Between Black and 
      White Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 2634-40
AB  - Background: Previous reports have shown differences in phenotypes among black
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with other racial groups,
      but prior studies were limited by small numbers of black patients and
      cross-sectional analyses. We used data from the Sinai-Helmsley Alliance for
      Research Excellence cohort to compare phenotypes and treatment patterns of black 
      and white patients with IBD in a prospective study. Methods: We compared
      phenotypes, IBD-specific therapies, and health care utilization among black and
      white patients with IBD. For all analyses, we performed bivariate analyses and
      multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Results:
      Among 5537 patients with IBD, 314 (6%) reported black race. Black patients were
      more likely to report a Crohn’s disease (CD)–related complication at baseline
      (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06–1.95). Black
      patients with CD were more likely to develop a new abscess (aOR, 2.27; 95% CI,
      1.31–3.93) and initiate an anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy during follow-up
      (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.09–3.14). Black patients with ulcerative colitis were more 
      likely to have proctitis (24% vs 13%, P = 0.033) at baseline. There were no
      differences in surgery or hospitalization rates during the follow-up period.
      Conclusions: Black patients with CD demonstrated increased complications at
      baseline and during follow-up in this cohort. Despite more complicated disease,
      black and white patients with IBD were generally given the same medications and
      experienced similar rates of hospitalization and surgery during the study period.
      In our multicenter cohort, clinical outcomes among black and white patients with 
      IBD were similar.

      Prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in later life: the ARIC
      Study.
PG  - 1406-15
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The interplay between midlife vascular risk factors (VRF) and
      midlife cognitive function with later life mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
      dementia (DEM) is not well understood. METHODS: In the Atherosclerosis Risk in
      Communities (ARIC) Study, cardiovascular risk factors and cognition were assessed
      in midlife, ages 45–64 years. In 2011–2013, 20–25 years later, all consenting
      ARIC participants underwent a cognitive and neurological evaluation, and were
      given adjudicated diagnoses of cognitively normal, MCI or DEM. RESULTS: In 5995
      participants with complete covariate data, midlife diabetes, hypertension,
      obesity and hypercholesterolemia were associated with late-life MCI and DEM. Low 
      midlife cognition was also associated with greater likelihood of late-life MCI or
      DEM. Both midlife VRF and midlife cognitive function remained associated with
      later life MCI or DEM when both were in the model. DISCUSSION: Later life MCI and
      DEM were independently associated with midlife VRF and midlife cognition.

TI  - Inherited Genetic Variants Associated with Melanoma BRAF/NRAS Subtypes.
PG  - 2398-404
AB  - BRAF and NRAS mutations arise early in melanoma development but their
      associations with low-penetrance melanoma susceptibility loci remain unknown. In 
      the Genes, Environment and Melanoma (GEM) Study, 1223 European-origin
      participants had their incident invasive primary melanomas screened for BRAF/NRAS
      mutations and germline DNA genotyped for 47 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) identified as low-penetrant melanoma risk variants. We used multinomial
      logistic regression to simultaneously examine each SNP’s relationship to BRAF
      V600E, BRAF V600K, BRAF other, and NRAS+ relative to BRAF−/NRAS− melanoma
      adjusted for study features. IRF4 rs12203592*T was associated with BRAF V600E (OR
      = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.43-0.79) and V600K (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.41-1.03), but not
      BRAF other or NRAS+ melanoma. A global test of etiologic heterogeneity (Pglobal =
      0.001) passed false discovery (Pglobal = 0.0026). PLA2G6 rs132985*T was
      associated with BRAF V600E (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.05-1.67) and BRAF other (OR =
      1.82, 95% CI = 1.11-2.98), but not BRAF V600K or NRAS+ melanoma. The test for
      etiologic heterogeneity (Pglobal) was 0.005. The IRF4 rs12203592 associations
      were slightly attenuated after adjustment for melanoma-risk phenotypes. The
      PLA2G6 rs132985 associations were independent of phenotypes. IRF4 and PLA2G6
      inherited genotypes may influence melanoma BRAF/NRAS subtype development.

TI  - Associations between the chemokine biomarker CCL2 and knee osteoarthritis
      outcomes: The Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project.
PG  - 1257-61
AB  - Objective: Our study analyzes the association between chemokine-ligand-2 (CCL2)
      serum concentrations at baseline and knee radiographic OA (knee-rOA), knee-rOA
      progression, individual radiographic features and knee symptomatic OA at 5-year
      follow-up. Design: OA outcomes were analyzed in a community-based cohort
      including a baseline enrollment and a 5-year follow-up. Baseline CCL2 serum
      concentrations were assessed by multiplex assay and associated with presence or
      progression of individual radiographic features at 5-year follow-up. Separate
      multiple logistic regression models were used to examine adjusted associations
      between baseline CCL2 and each of the knee OA variables at follow-up. CCL2 at
      baseline was modeled as an explanatory variable, whereas each of the knee OA
      variables at follow-up served as the response variables. Models were adjusted for
      age, BMI, race, and sex. Trend tests were conducted to assess any linear effect
      on outcomes across CCL2 tertiles. Results: Participants (n=168) had a median age 
      of 57-years and median BMI of 29 kg/m2. About 63% of all participants were women,
      and 58% Caucasian (42% African American). In adjusted logistic models, continuous
      log-CCL2 was significantly associated with knee-rOA. For each unit increase in
      log CCL2, the odds of having knee-rOA at follow-up was increased by 72%. CCL2
      tertiles showed significant linear associations with presence and progression of 
      knee-rOA and medial joint space narrowing, but not with presence or progression
      of osteophytes, bone sclerosis, knee symptoms, or symptomatic knee-rOA.
      Conclusions: Serum CCL2 may help to elucidate some mechanisms of joint
      destruction and identify individuals with higher odds of structural knee changes.

LID - 10.1111/pedi.12690
AB  - Background: Few studies have evaluated the prospective association of eating
      frequency with HbA1c levels and cardiovascular disease risk markers among youth
      with diabetes. Objective: To examine the 5-year longitudinal association of
      eating frequency with HbA1c and serum lipid levels among youth with type 1
      diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: 1,049 youth (≥10 years old)
      with incident T1D (n=821) or T2D (n=228) who participated in the SEARCH for
      Diabetes in Youth Study were included. Eating frequency (≤3, 4-5 or 6-10
      times/day) measured at baseline and follow-up visits was related to HbA1c and
      serum lipid levels measured repeatedly over 5 years. Results: Increased eating
      frequency was associated with larger increases in HbA1c among youth T1D. For
      example, for youth with T1D who ate ≤ 3 times/day at the outset and ate 6-10
      times/day 5 years later, the longitudinal model predicted greater absolute
      increases in HbA1c (2.77%); whereas for youth with T1D who ate 6-10 times/day at 
      the outset and ate ≤3 times/day 5 years later, the model predicted lesser
      absolute increases in HbA1c (1.33%). Eating frequency was not associated with
      changes in serum lipid levels among youth with T1D or T2D. Conclusions: Youth
      with T1D who increased their eating frequency vs. those who decreased it had
      larger increases in HbA1c over 5 years.

TI  - Factors Associated with Falls in Older Adults with Cancer: A Validated Model from
      the Cancer and Aging Research Group.
PG  - 3563-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls in older adults with cancer are common, yet factors associated 
      with fall-risk are not well-defined and may differ from the general geriatric
      population. This study aims to develop and validate a model of factors associated
      with prior falls among older adults with cancer. METHODS: In this cross-sectional
      secondary analysis, two cohorts of patients aged ≥65 with cancer were examined to
      develop and validate a model of factors associated with falls in the prior 6
      months. Potential independent variables, including demographic and laboratory
      data and a geriatric assessment (encompassing comorbidities, functional status,
      physical performance, medications and psychosocial status), were identified. A
      multivariate model was developed in the derivation cohort using an exhaustive
      modeling approach. The model selected for validation offered a low Akaike
      Information Criteria value and included dichotomized variables for ease of
      clinical use. This model was then applied in the validation cohort. RESULTS: The 
      development cohort (N=498) had a mean age of 73 (range 65-91). Nearly one-fifth
      (18.2%) reported a fall in the prior 6 months. The selected model comprised 9
      variables involving functional status, objective physical performance,
      depression, medications and renal function. The AUC of the model was 0.72 (95%
      confidence intervals 0.65-0.78). In the validation cohort (N=250), the prevalence
      of prior falls was 23.6%. The AUC of the model in the validation cohort was 0.62 
      (95% confidence intervals 0.51-0.71). CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed and
      validated a model of factors associated with prior falls in older adults with
      cancer. Future study is needed to examine the utility of such a model in
      prospectively predicting incident falls.

TI  - Serum Uromodulin: A Biomarker of Long-Term Kidney Allograft Failure.
PG  - 275-82
AB  - Background:: Uromodulin is a kidney-derived glycoprotein and putative tubular
      function index. Lower serum uromodulin was recently associated with increased
      risk for kidney allograft failure in a preliminary, longitudinal single-center
      European study involving 91 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Methods:: The
      Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction in Transplantation (FAVORIT) trial is a
      completed, large, multiethnic controlled clinical trial cohort, which studied
      chronic, stable KTRs. We conducted a case cohort analysis using a randomly
      selected subset of patients (random subcohort, n = 433), and all individuals who 
      developed kidney allograft failure (cases, n = 226) during follow-up. Serum
      uromodulin was determined in this total of n = 613 FAVORIT trial participants at 
      randomization. Death-censored kidney allograft failure was the study outcome.
      Results:: The 226 kidney allograft failures occurred during a median surveillance
      of 3.2 years. Unadjusted, weighted Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed
      that lower serum uromodulin, tertile 1 vs. tertile 3, was associated with a
      threefold greater risk for kidney allograft failure (hazards ratio [HR], 95% CI
      3.20 [2.05–5.01]). This association was attenuated but persisted at two-fold
      greater risk for allograft failure, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking,
      allograft type and vintage, prevalent diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular
      disease (CVD), total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, systolic blood
      pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and natural log urinary
      albumin/creatinine: HR 2.00, 95% CI (1.06–3.77). Conclusions:: Lower serum
      uromodulin, a possible indicator of less well-preserved renal tubular function,
      remained associated with greater risk for kidney allograft failure, after
      adjustment for major, established clinical kidney allograft failure and CVD risk 
      factors, in a large, multiethnic cohort of long-term, stable KTRs.

TI  - Comparing and Validating Machine Learning Models for Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      Drug Discovery.
PG  - 4346-60
AB  - Tuberculosis is a global health dilemma. In 2016, the WHO reported 10.4 million
      incidences and 1.7 million deaths. The need to develop new treatments for those
      infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has led to many large-scale
      phenotypic screens and many thousands of new active compounds identified in
      vitro. However, with limited funding, efforts to discover new active molecules
      against Mtb needs to be more efficient. Several computational machine learning
      approaches have been shown to have good enrichment and hit rates. We have curated
      small molecule Mtb data and developed new models with a total of 18,886 molecules
      with activity cut offs of 10 µM, 1 µM and 100 nM. These datasets were used to
      evaluate different machine learning methods (including deep learning) and metrics
      and generate predictions for additional molecules published in 2017. One Mtb
      model, a combined in vitro and in vivo data Bayesian model at a 100 nM activity
      yielded the following metrics for 5-fold cross validation: Accuracy = 0.88,
      Precision = 0.22, Recall = 0.91, Specificity = 0.88, Kappa = 0.31, and MCC =
      0.41. We have also curated an evaluation set (n = 153 compounds) published in
      2017 and when used to test our model it showed the comparable statistics
      (Accuracy = 0.83, Precision = 0.27, Recall = 1.00, Specificity = 0.81, Kappa =
      0.36, and MCC = 0.47). We have also compared these models with additional machine
      learning algorithms showing Bayesian machine learning models constructed with
      literature Mtb data generated by different labs generally were equivalent to or
      outperformed Deep Neural Networks with external test sets. Finally, we have also 
      compared our training and test sets to show they were suitably diverse and
      different in order to represent useful evaluation sets. Such Mtb machine learning
      models could help prioritize compounds for testing in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Delayed Ileal Pouch Anal Anastomosis Has a Lower 30-Day Adverse Event Rate:
      Analysis From the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.
PG  - 1833-9
AB  - Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients requiring colectomy often have a
      staged ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). There are no prospective data
      comparing timing of pouch creation. We aimed to compare 30-day adverse event
      rates for pouch creation at the time of colectomy (PTC) with delayed pouch
      creation (DPC). Methods: Using prospectively collected data from 2011–2015
      through the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, we conducted a cohort 
      study including subjects aged ≥18 years with a postoperative diagnosis of UC. We 
      assessed 30-day postoperative rates of unplanned readmissions, reoperations, and 
      major and minor adverse events (AEs), comparing the stage of the surgery where
      the pouch creation took place. Using a modified Poisson regression model, we
      estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for
      age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes, albumin, and
      comorbidities. Results: Of 2390 IPAA procedures, 1571 were PTC and 819 were DPC. 
      In the PTC group, 51% were on chronic immunosuppression preoperatively, compared 
      with 15% in the DPC group (P < 0.01). After controlling for confounders, patients
      who had DPC were significantly less likely to have unplanned reoperations (RR,
      0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.75), major AEs (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52–0.99), and minor AEs 
      (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32–0.73) than PTC. Conclusions: Patients undergoing delayed 
      pouch creation were at lower risk for unplanned reoperations and major and minor 
      adverse events compared with patients undergoing pouch creation at the time of
      colectomy.

TI  - Environmental or Nasal Cannula Supplemental Oxygen (ECO) for Preterm Infants: A
      Randomized Cross-Over Trial.
PG  - 98-103
AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that environmental compared with nasal cannula 
      oxygen decreases episodes of intermittent hypoxemia (oxygen saturations <85% for 
      ≥10 seconds) in preterm infants on supplemental oxygen by providing a more stable
      hypopharyngeal oxygen concentration. Study design: This was a single center
      randomized cross-over trial with a 1:1 parallel allocation to order of testing.
      Preterm infants on supplemental oxygen via oxygen environment maintained by a
      servo-controlled system or nasal cannula with flow rates ≤ 1.0 liter per kilogram
      per minute were crossed-over every 24 hours for 96 hours. Data were collected
      electronically to capture real time numeric and waveform data from patient
      monitors. Results: Twenty-five infants with gestational age of 27 ± 2 weeks (mean
      ± standard deviation) and a birth weight of 933 ± 328 grams were studied at
      postnatal day 36 ± 26. The number of episodes of intermittent hypoxemia per 24
      hours was 117 ± 77 (median, 98; range, 4–335) with oxygen environment versus 130 
      ± 63 (median, 136; range, 16–252) with nasal cannula (p=0.002). Infants on oxygen
      environment compared with nasal cannula also had decreased episodes of severe
      intermittent hypoxemia (P = .005). Infants on oxygen environment compared with
      nasal cannula had a lower proportion of time with oxygen saturations < 85% (0.05 
      ± 0.03 vs 0.06 ± 0.03, p<0.001), and a lower coefficient of variation of oxygen
      saturation (p=0.02). Conclusion: In preterm infants receiving supplemental
      oxygen, servo-controlled oxygen environment decreases hypoxemia compared with
      nasal cannula. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02794662

TI  - Phase II Study of Two Weeks on, One Week off Sunitinib Scheduling in Patients
      With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 1588-93
AB  - Purpose: Standard frontline treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma currently includes sunitinib. A barrier to long-term treatment with
      sunitinib includes the development of significant adverse effects, including
      diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), and fatigue. This trial assessed the effect
      of an alternate 2 weeks on, 1 week off (2/1) schedule of sunitinib on toxicity
      and efficacy in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma. Methods: Patients started with oral administration of 50 mg sunitinib 
      on a 2/1 schedule and underwent schedule and dose alterations if toxicity
      developed. The primary end point was < 15% grade ≥ 3 fatigue, diarrhea, or HFS.
      With 60 patients, the upper bound of the CI would fall below the published 4/2
      schedule grade ≥ 3 toxicity rate of 25% to 30%. Results: Fifty-nine patients were
      treated between August 2014 and March 2016. Seventy-seven percent were
      intermediate or poor risk per Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria.
      With a median follow-up of 17 months, 25% of patients experienced grade 3
      fatigue, HFS, or diarrhea; 37% required a dose reduction, and 10% discontinued
      because of toxicity. The overall response rate was 57%, median progression-free
      survival was 13.7 months, and median overall survival was not reached. At 12
      weeks, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General scores dropped between 0% 
      and 10% from baseline, with less reduction in patients who continued treatment
      longer. Conclusion: The primary end point of decreased grade 3 toxicity was not
      met; however, treatment with a 2/1 sunitinib schedule is associated with a lack
      of grade 4 toxicity, a low patient discontinuation rate, and high efficacy.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Carvedilol Versus Metoprolol Initiation and 1-Year
      Mortality Among Individuals Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis.
PG  - 337-48
AB  - Background:: Carvedilol and metoprolol are the beta-blockers most commonly
      prescribed to U.S. hemodialysis patients, accounting for approximately 80% of
      beta-blocker prescriptions. Despite well-established pharmacologic and
      pharmacokinetic differences between the two medications, little is known about
      their relative safety and efficacy in the hemodialysis population. Study design::
      A retrospective cohort study using a new-user design. Setting & participants::
      Medicare-enrolled hemodialysis patients treated at a large U.S. dialysis
      organization who initiated carvedilol or metoprolol therapy from 01/01/2007
      through 12/30/2012. Predictor:: Carvedilol versus metoprolol initiation.
      Outcomes:: All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and intradialytic
      hypotension (systolic blood pressure drop ≥20 mmHg during hemodialysis plus
      intradialytic saline administration) during a 1-year follow-up period.
      Measurements:: Survival models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) in mortality analyses. Poisson regression was used to 
      estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs in intradialytic hypotension
      analyses. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for
      several demographic, clinical, laboratory and dialysis treatment covariates in
      all analyses. Results:: 27,064 individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis
      were included: 9,558 (35.3%) carvedilol initiators and 17,506 (64.7%) metoprolol 
      initiators. Carvedilol (versus metoprolol) initiation was associated with greater
      all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.16) and cardiovascular
      mortality (adjusted HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08–1.29). In subgroup analyses, similar
      associations were observed among patients with hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
      heart failure, and a recent myocardial infarction, the main cardiovascular
      indications for beta-blocker therapy. During follow-up, carvedilol (versus
      metoprolol) initiators had a higher rate of intradialytic hypotension (adjusted
      IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.09–1.11). Limitations:: Residual confounding may exist.
      Conclusions:: Relative to metoprolol initiation, carvedilol initiation was
      associated with higher 1-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. One
      potential mechanism for these findings may be the increased occurrence of
      intradialytic hypotension after carvedilol (versus metoprolol) initiation.

TI  - Syndemic effect of mental illness and substance use on viral suppression among
      recently-incarcerated, HIV-infected individuals in the CARE+ Corrections study.
PG  - 1252-6
AB  - Few studies on HIV-related syndemics of co-occurring and mutually reinforcing
      psychosocial conditions have assessed clinical outcomes in criminal justice
      (CJ)-involved populations. Baseline data from the CARE+ Corrections study were
      used to quantify co-occurring mental illness and substance use and examine
      syndemic effects on viral suppression among 106 CJ-involved HIV-infected
      individuals. Ninety-one (86%) reported a mental illness diagnosis, 30 (28%)
      reported hazardous alcohol use, and 61 (58%) were drug dependent. Eighteen (17%) 
      experienced all three conditions. Drug dependence was clustered with mental
      illness (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 3.20, 95% CI 1.01–10.14) and hazardous
      alcohol use (POR 2.61, 95% CI 1.03–6.56). The association between syndemic score,
      representing the number of conditions reported by each individual, and viral
      suppression was not statistically significant, although 86% of participants with 
      none of these conditions were virally suppressed, compared to 56% of those with
      all three (p = 0.56). Mental illness and substance use were concentrated in this 
      sample, indicating a need for integrated care services.

TI  - Recurrent Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Admissions for Patients With Reduced 
      Versus Preserved Ejection Fraction (from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
      Study).
PG  - 108-14
AB  - Hospitals are required to report all-cause 30-day resadmissions for patients
      discharged with heart failure. Same-cause readmissions have received less
      attention but may differ for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
      versus heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The ARIC study
      began abstracting medical records for cohort members hospitalized with acute
      decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in 2005. ADHF was validated by physician
      review, with HFrEF defined by ejection fraction <50%. Recurrent admissions for
      ADHF were analyzed within 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year of the index
      hospitalization using repeat-measures Cox regression models. All recurrent ADHF
      admissions per patient were counted rather than the more typical analysis of only
      the first occurring readmission. From 2005 to 2014, 1,133 cohort members survived
      at least 1 hospitalization for ADHF and had ejection fraction recorded. Half were
      classified as HFpEF. Patients with HFpEF were more often women and had more
      comorbidities. The overall ADHF readmission rate was greatest within 30 days of
      discharge but was higher for patients with HFrEF (115 vs 88 readmissions per 100 
      person-years). After adjustments for demographics, year of admission, and
      co-morbidities, there was a trend for higher ADHF readmissions with HFrEF,
      relative to HFpEF, at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval
      [CI] 0.92 to 2.18), 90 days (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.85), 6 months (HR 1.47,
      95% CI, 1.18 to 1.84), and 1 year (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.70) of follow-up. In
      conclusion, patients with HFrEF have a greater burden of short- and long-term
      readmissions for recurrent ADHF.

TI  - Incidence, Characterization and Impact of Newly Detected Donor Specific Anti-HLA 
      Antibody in the First Year after Pediatric Heart Transplantation: A Report From
      the CTOTC-04 Study.
PG  - 2163-74
AB  - Data on the clinical importance of newly detected donor specific antibodies
      (ndDSA) following pediatric heart transplantation is lacking despite mounting
      evidence of the detrimental effect of de novo DSA in solid organ transplantation.
      We prospectively tested 237 pediatric heart transplant recipients for ndDSA in
      the first year post-transplant in order to determine their incidence, pattern and
      clinical impact. One third of patients developed ndDSA; when present, these were 
      mostly detected within the first 6 weeks after transplant suggesting that memory 
      responses may predominate over true de novo DSA production in this population. In
      the absence of pre-existing DSA, patients with ndDSA had significantly more acute
      cellular rejection but not antibody-mediated rejection, and there was no impact
      on graft and patient survival in the first year post-transplant. Risk factors for
      ndDSA included common sensitizing events. Given the early detection of the
      antibody response, memory responses may be more important in the first year
      following pediatric heart transplantation and patients with a history of a
      sensitizing event may be at risk even with a negative pre-transplant antibody
      screen. The impact on late graft and patient outcomes of first year ndDSA is
      being assessed in an extended cohort of patients.

TI  - Study Rationale, Design and Pre-Transplant Alloantibody Status: A First Report of
      Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation in Children-04 (CTOTC-04) in Pediatric
      Heart Transplantation.
PG  - 2135-47
AB  - Anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies are associated with worse outcomes following
      organ transplantation. Among sensitized pediatric heart candidates, requirement
      for negative donor-specific cytotoxicity crossmatch increases wait times and
      mortality. However, transplantation with positive crossmatch may increase
      post-transplant morbidity and mortality. We address this clinical challenge in a 
      prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study of children listed for
      heart transplantation (CTOTC-04). Outcomes were compared among sensitized
      recipients who underwent transplant with positive crossmatch, non-sensitized
      recipients, and sensitized recipients without positive crossmatch. Positive
      crossmatch recipients received antibody removal and augmented immunosuppression, 
      while other recipients received standard immunosuppression with corticosteroid
      avoidance. This first CTOTC-04 report summarizes study rationale and design, and 
      reports on pre-transplant sensitization status using solid phase technology. Risk
      factors for sensitization were explored. Of 317 screened patients, 290 were
      enrolled and 240 underwent transplantation. Core laboratory evaluation
      demonstrated that over half of patients were anti-HLA sensitized. Over 80% of
      sensitized patients had class I (with or without class II) HLA antibodies, and
      one third of sensitized patients had at least one HLA antibody with median
      fluorescence intensity (MFI) ≥8000. Logistic regression models demonstrated male 
      sex, weight, congenital heart disease history, prior allograft and ventricular
      assist device are independent risk factors for sensitization.

TI  - Genetics of Human Longevity From Incomplete Data: New Findings From the Long Life
      Family Study.
PG  - 1472-81
AB  - The special design of the Long Life Family Study provides a unique opportunity to
      investigate the genetics of human longevity by analyzing data on exceptional
      lifespans in families. In this article, we performed two series of genome wide
      association studies of human longevity which differed with respect to whether
      missing lifespan data were predicted or not predicted. We showed that the use of 
      predicted lifespan is most beneficial when the follow-up period is relatively
      short. In addition to detection of strong associations of SNPs in APOE, TOMM40,
      NECTIN2, and APOC1 genes with longevity, we also detected a strong new
      association with longevity of rs1927465, located between the CYP26A1 and MYOF
      genes on chromosome 10. The association was confirmed using data from the Health 
      and Retirement Study. We discuss the biological relevance of the detected SNPs to
      human longevity.

TI  - Longitudinal Analysis of Parent Communication Behaviors and Child Distress during
      Cancer Port Start Procedures.
PG  - 487-96
AB  - Background:: The roles parents play in supporting their child during painful
      cancer procedures have been studied as communication strategies versus a broader 
      caring framework and from a cross-sectional versus longitudinal perspective.
      Objectives:: To examine the longitudinal change in parent communication behaviors
      over repeated cancer port start procedures experienced by their children.
      Methods:: This study used a longitudinal design. Two trained raters coded 104
      recorded videos of port starts from 43 children being treated for cancer. This
      included 25 children with two video-recorded port starts and 18 children with
      three (T1, T2, T3). The Parent Caring Response Scoring System derived from
      Swanson’s Caring Theory was used to code parent communication behaviors as caring
      responses during their children’s port starts. Three 3- to 5-minute slices
      (pre-port start, during, and post—port start) were coded for each video. Mixed
      modeling with generalized estimating equations and Friedman test were used to
      analyze longitudinal change in parent behaviors. Results:: Significant
      differences were found between T1 versus T3 in eye contact (β = −1.05, p = .02), 
      distance-close-enough-to-touch (β = −0.81, p = .03), nonverbal comforting (β =
      −1.34, p = .04), and availability (β = −0.92, p = .036), suggesting that more
      parents used communication behaviors at T3 compared with T1. Parent burdensome or
      intrusive questions (e.g., Why do you cry? β = −1.11, p = .03) and nonverbal
      comforting (β = −1.52, p = .047) increased from T2 to T3. The median values of
      parent communication behaviors overall had no significant changes from T1 to T3. 
      Conclusion:: Parents adjusted to use more nonverbal caring behaviors as their
      child experienced additional port starts. Experimental studies should be designed
      to help parents use caring behaviors to better support their children during
      cancer procedures.

TI  - Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and increased risk of serrated polyps:
      results from a randomized clinical trial.
LID - gutjnl-2017-315242
AB  - Objective:: Serrated lesions such as sessile serrated adenomas or polyps (SSA/Ps)
      are important colorectal cancer precursors, but etiological factors for these
      lesions are largely unknown. We aimed to determine the effects of calcium and
      vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of serrated polyps (SPs) in general
      and hyperplastic polyps and SSA/Ps specifically. Design:: Participants with one
      or more adenoma at baseline were randomized to receive 1200 mg/day of elemental
      calcium, 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3, both, or neither agent. Treatment continued 
      for 3 or 5 years, when risk of polyps was determined from surveillance
      colonoscopy (treatment phase). Outcomes after treatment ceased were also assessed
      (observational phase). Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) of SPs were determined via
      multivariable generalized linear models. Results:: SPs were diagnosed in 565 of
      2058 (27.5%) participants during the treatment phase, and 329/1108 (29.7%) during
      the observational phase. In total, 211 SSA/Ps were identified during follow up.
      In the treatment phase, there was no effect of either calcium or vitamin D on
      incidence of SSA/Ps. However, during the later observational phase, we observed
      elevated risks of SSA/Ps associated with calcium alone and calcium + vitamin D
      treatment [aRR (95% CI): 2.66 (1.44–4.89) and 3.82 (1.26–11.57 respectively].
      Conclusion:: In a large multicenter chemoprevention study, we found evidence that
      calcium and vitamin D supplementation increased the risk of SSA/Ps. This appeared
      to be a late effect: 6–10 years after supplementation began. These possible risks
      must be weighed against the benefits of calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

TI  - Osseointegrated Implants for Auricular Prostheses: An Alternative to Autologous
      Repair.
PG  - 2153-6
AB  - Objectives: This study compares the hospital cost of osseointegrated implants for
      retention of an auricular prosthesis to autologous ear reconstruction. Methods:
      This retrospective review includes patients who underwent reconstruction for
      either congenital or acquired ear defects at Duke University Medical Center
      during 2009–2015. Results: A total of 9 patients had autologous repair
      representing 9 operative ears and 16 patients had an osseointegrated implant
      representing 18 operative ears (2 bilateral). The average age for the autologous 
      repair was 11.6 years with 56% male vs 40.7 years with 56% male for the
      osseointegrated implant patients. For autologous patients, indications for
      surgery were anotia/microtia in 8/9 (89%) and trauma in 1/9 (11%) vs 6/16
      (387.5%) anotia/microtia, 8/16 (50%) cancer, and 2/16 (132.5%) trauma in the
      osseointegrated implant group. The mean number of surgeries was 3.1 for
      autologous repairs and 1.0 for osseointegrated repairs (mean difference CI −2.4
      to −1.8 P <0.001). The average cost to the hospital for an osseointegrated repair
      was $6491.39 vs $10047.93 for autologous repairs (CI −$6496.38 to $−616.68, P =
      0.02) Conclusions: Osseointegrated implants for retaining an auricular prosthesis
      has a similar cost to autologous repair of ear defects, but patients underwent an
      average of 2 more surgeries with autologous repair. Patients should be able to
      choose the reconstruction option that best suits their condition and preferences.

TI  - The association of cardiorespiratory fitness with cardiometabolic factors,
      markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in Latino Youth. Findings
      from HCHS/SOL Youth.
PG  - 583-589.e3
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the relationship of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and a biomarker of endothelial
      dysfunction (e-selectin) among Hispanic/Latino youth. Methods: The study included
      1380 Hispanic/Latino youths (8-16 years old) from the Hispanic Children Health
      Study/Study Of Latino Youth (HCHS/SOL Youth) that enrolled from four cities
      (Bronx, Chicago, Miami, and San Diego). CRF was assessed by a 3-min step test
      that uses post-exercise heart rate to estimate maximal oxygen uptake. Regression 
      models assessed differences in cardiometabolic markers across quartiles of CRF,
      adjusting for potential confounders. Results: CRF was higher among boys (mean:
      57.6 ml/kg/min, 95% CI: 56.8, 58.4) compared to girls (mean: 54.7 ml/kg/min, 95% 
      CI: 53.9, 55.5). Higher levels of CRF were associated with more favorable levels 
      of cardiometabolic, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction factors
      (p-values<0.001) and independently of physical activity and sedentary time.
      Compared to the lowest quartile of CRF, the odds of having ≥2 CVD risk factors
      was lower at higher quartiles of CRF, after adjustment for potential confounders.
      Conclusions: Among Hispanic/Latino youth, CRF appears to be a strong protective
      factor for endothelial dysfunction and cardiometabolic risk factors. Strategies
      to improve CRF may be a useful approach for improving cardiovascular health in
      youth.

TI  - The Safety Explorer Suite: Interactive Safety Monitoring for Clinical Trials.
PG  - 696-700
AB  - Background: Frequent and thorough monitoring of patient safety is a requirement
      of clinical trials research. Safety data are traditionally reported in a tabular 
      or listing format, which often translates into many pages of static displays.
      This poses the risk that clinically relevant signals will be obscured by the
      sheer volume of data reported. Interactive graphics enable the delivery of the
      vast scope of information found in traditional reports, but allow the user to
      interact with the charts in real time, focusing on signals of interest. Methods: 
      Clinical research staff, including biostatisticians, project managers, and a
      medical monitor were consulted to guide the development of a set of interactive
      data visualizations that enable key safety assessments for participants. The
      resulting “Safety Explorer” is a set of 6 interactive, web-based, open source
      tools designed to address the shortcomings of traditional, static reports for
      safety monitoring. Results: The Safety Explorer is freely available on GitHub as 
      individual JavaScript libraries: Adverse Event Explorer, Adverse Event Timelines,
      Safety Histogram, Safety Outlier Explorer, Safety Results Over Time, and Safety
      Shift Plot, or in a single combined framework: Safety Explorer Suite. The suite
      can also be utilized through its R interface, the safetyexploreR package.
      Conclusions: The Safety Explorer provides interactive charts that contain the
      same information available in standard displays, but the interactive interface
      allows for improved exploration of patterns and comparisons. Medical Monitors,
      Safety Review Boards, and Project Teams can use these tools to effectively track 
      and analyze key safety variables and study endpoints.

PG  - 888-905
AB  - Objective:: Exercise behaviour change involves multiple experiences with success 
      and failure. The Model of Action Phases (MAP) offers a dynamic account of how
      success and failure influence both immediate evaluations and future decisions and
      actions. However, predictions from the MAP have not been formally tested.
      Design:: A longitudinal daily diary study was used to examine how post-behaviour 
      evaluations of exercise success and failure influence subsequent exercise
      intentions and behaviour. Participants (N = 104) set exercise goals, and then
      kept a daily online exercise diary for four weeks. Main Outcome Measures::
      Participants self-reported exercise behaviour, affective response to exercise,
      self-evaluations after success or failure at following through on intentions to
      exercise, and intentions to exercise in the next week. Results:: Multilevel
      modelling revealed significant within- and between-participant relationships
      among post-behaviour evaluations, intentions, and subsequent behaviour. Findings 
      supported MAP-derived predictions about how success and failure at exercise are
      associated with feelings about exercise and the self, and inform subsequent
      exercise intentions and behaviour. Conclusion:: Positive post-behaviour
      evaluations of success or failure may stabilize positive intentions and aid
      maintenance of exercise behaviour. Implications of these MAP-based findings for
      intervention design are discussed.

TI  - Public misperception that very low nicotine cigarettes are less carcinogenic.
PG  - 712-4
AB  - Objective: The US is considering a very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarette
      standard. We sought to characterize the prevalence and correlates of the
      incorrect belief that VLNC cigarettes are less carcinogenic than current
      cigarettes, as this could reduce motivation to quit. Methods: Participants were a
      nationally-representative sample of 650 adult smokers in the US. In 2015–2016,
      before the VLNC proposal became public, these smokers took part in an online
      survey. We used multivariate weighted analyses to calculate odds ratios and
      percentages and a chi square test to examine the association between variables.
      Results: Overall, 47.1% of smokers believed that smoking VLNC cigarettes for 30
      years would be less likely to cause cancer than smoking current cigarettes. This 
      misperception was more common among smokers who were age 55+ (56.6%) and black
      (57.4%). Additionally, 23.9% of smokers reported they would be less likely to
      quit if the US adopted a VLNC standard. Thinking that VLNC cigarettes would be
      less carcinogenic was associated with smokers reporting they would be less likely
      to quit (p < .01). Conclusions: Many smokers had the misperception that smoking
      VLNC cigarettes is less likely to cause cancer, and some stated that they would
      be less likely to quit. A VLNC standard may be more effective if accompanied by a
      communication campaign that emphasizes the continued dangers of smoking VLNC
      cigarettes due to the many toxic chemicals in smoke.

TI  - Unfair treatment and periodontitis among adults in the Hispanic Community Health 
      Study/ Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).
PG  - 1093-106
AB  - This study investigates how perceived unfair treatment, towards self and observed
      towards others due to ethnicity, are associated with periodontitis among diverse 
      Hispanic/Latino adults, accounting for socio-demographic, health behavior, and
      acculturation factors. Baseline (2008–2011) dental and survey data from the
      Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a multi-center
      epidemiologic study, were analyzed (N=12,750). Crude and adjusted prevalence
      ratios and confidence limits were estimated. Half (49%) reported never being
      treated unfairly, while 41% reported they were sometimes, and 10% reported it
      often/always. One-third (32%) never saw others treated unfairly, while 42%
      reported it sometimes, and 26% reported it often/always. In the final fully
      adjusted model, the prevalence of periodontitis was higher among adults who were:
      non-Dominican, older, male, had a past year dental visit, current and former
      smokers, and among those who observed unfair treatment towards others. Lower
      prevalence was associated with: higher income, higher educational attainment,
      less than full-time employment, reporting experiencing unfair treatment, higher
      acculturation scores, and having health insurance. Perceived unfair treatment
      towards self was negatively associated with periodontitis prevalence, while
      observed unfair treatment towards others was positively associated with the
      outcome among diverse Hispanics/Latinos. The associations between unfair
      treatment and periodontitis warrant further exploration.

TI  - Safety and Effectiveness of Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir, With or Without Ribavirin,
      in Treatment-Experienced Patients with Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus Infection and
      Cirrhosis.
PG  - 1811-1819.e4
AB  - Background & Aims: We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 12 or 24 
      weeks treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin, in
      treatment-experienced patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection 
      and cirrhosis in routine clinical practice. Patients were followed in a
      multi-center, prospective, observational cohort study (HCV-TARGET). Methods: We
      collected data from 667 treatment-experienced adults with chronic genotype 1 HCV 
      infection who began treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, with or without
      ribavirin, from 2011 through September 15, 2016, according to the regional
      standards of care, at academic (n=39) and community (n=18) centers in the United 
      States, Canada, Germany, and Israel. Information was collected from medical
      records and abstracted into a unique centralized data core. Independent monitors 
      systematically reviewed data entries for completeness and accuracy. Demographic, 
      clinical, adverse event, and virologic data were collected every 12 weeks during 
      treatment and during the follow-up period. The primary efficacy endpoint was
      sustained virologic response, defined as a level of HCV RNA below the lower limit
      of quantification or undetectable at a minimum 64 days after the end of treatment
      (SVR12). The per-protocol population (n=610) was restricted to patients who
      completed 12 or 24 weeks of treatment (±2 weeks) and had final virologic outcomes
      available. Results: The per-protocol analysis revealed that 579 patients (93.8%) 
      achieved an SVR12, including 50/51 patients who received ledipasvir and
      sofosbuvir for 12 weeks (98%), 384/408 patients who received ledipasvir and
      sofosbuvir for 24 weeks (94.1%), 68/70 patients who received ledipasvir and
      sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks (97.1%), and 57/60 patients who received
      ledipasvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 24 weeks (95%). On multivariate
      analysis, neither treatment duration nor the addition of ribavirin was associated
      with SVR12. Compensated cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR] compared to decompensated
      cirrhosis, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.16–5.02), albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL (OR, 3.15; 95% CI
      1.46–6.80), or total bilirubin ≤ 1.2 mg/dL (OR 3.34; 95% CI, 1.59–7.00) were
      associated with SVR12. Conclusions: In an analysis of safety and effectiveness
      data from the HCV-TARGET study, we found treatment with ledipasvir and
      sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin, to be effective and well tolerated by
      treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and compensated
      cirrhosis. There were no significant differences in rate of SVR12 among patients 
      treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 or 24 weeks, with or without
      ribavirin. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis appear to benefit from the
      addition of ribavirin or extension of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir treatment to 24
      weeks. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT10474811.

TI  - Understanding Men’s Networks and Perceptions of Leadership to Promote HIV Testing
      and Treatment in Agincourt, South Africa.
PG  - 1296-306
AB  - Understanding informal leadership in high HIV prevalence settings is important
      for the success of popular opinion leader (POL) and other testing and treatment
      promotion strategies which aim to leverage the influence of these leaders. We
      conducted a study in Mpumalanga province, South Africa, in which we aimed to: 1) 
      Describe men’s personal networks and key social relationships; and 2) describe
      the types of individuals men identify as leaders. We administered a structured
      questionnaire with 45 men (15 HIV-positive and 30 HIV-negative) in which men
      enumerated and described characteristics of individuals they share personal
      matters with, and people they considered as leaders. We further conducted
      in-depth interviews with 25 of these men to better understand men’s
      conceptualization of leadership in their community. Family members were prominent
      in men’s personal networks and among the leaders they nominated. Men living with 
      HIV were much more likely to know others living with HIV, and described
      friendships on the basis of the shared experience of HIV treatment. Future POL
      interventions aiming to promote HIV testing and care among men in rural South
      Africa should consider the importance of family in community leadership, and seek
      to leverage the influence of connections between men living with HIV.

TI  - ENDOTHELIAL ALTERATIONS IN A CANINE MODEL OF IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA.
PG  - 88-97
AB  - Bleeding heterogeneity amongst patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is
      poorly understood. Platelets play a role in maintaining endothelial integrity,
      and variable thrombocytopenia-induced endothelial changes may influence bleeding 
      severity. Platelet-derived endothelial stabilizers and markers of endothelial
      integrity in ITP are largely underexplored. We hypothesized that, in a canine ITP
      model, thrombocytopenia would lead to alterations in endothelial ultrastructure
      and that von Willebrand factor (vWF) would serve as a marker of endothelial
      injury associated with thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was induced in healthy 
      dogs with an anti-platelet antibody infusion; control dogs received an isotype
      control antibody. Cutaneous biopsies were obtained prior to thrombocytopenia
      induction, at platelet nadir, 24 hours after nadir, and on platelet recovery.
      Cutaneous capillaries were assessed by electron microscopy for vessel thickness, 
      number of pinocytotic vesicles, number of large vacuoles, and number of gaps
      between cells. Pinocytotic vesicles are thought to represent an endothelial
      membrane reserve that can be used for repair of damaged endothelial cells. Plasma
      samples were assessed for vWF. ITP dogs had significantly decreased pinocytotic
      vesicle numbers compared to control dogs (P= 0.0357) and the increase in plasma
      vWF from baseline to 24 hours correlated directly with the endothelial large
      vacuole score (R = 0.99103; P<0.0001). This direct correlation between plasma vWF
      and the number of large vacuoles, representing the vesiculo-vacuolar organelle
      (VVO), a permeability structure, suggests that circulating vWF could serve as a
      biomarker for endothelial alterations and potentially a predictor of
      thrombocytopenic bleeding. Overall, our results indicate that endothelial damage 
      occurs in the canine ITP model and variability in the degree of endothelial
      damage may account for differences in bleeding phenotype among patients with ITP.

TI  - The Influence of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior on Living to Age 85
      Years Without Disease and Disability in Older Women.
PG  - 1525-31
AB  - Background: Whether physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior influence the
      odds of women living to age 85 years without chronic disease or disability is not
      well described. Methods: Participants of the Women’s Health Initiative (n =
      49,612) were categorized based on health status by age 85 years: (i) lived
      without developing major chronic disease or mobility disability (“healthy”); (ii)
      lived and developed mobility disability with or without disease; (iii) lived and 
      developed major chronic disease, but not mobility disability; and (iv) died
      before their 85th birth year. Multinomial logistic regression models that
      adjusted for covariates such as age, race/ethnicity, and body size estimated
      associations of self-reported PA and sitting time on developing major disease or 
      mobility disability or dying before age 85 relative to being healthy. Results:
      Mean ± SD baseline age was 70.2 ± 3.6 years. Distributions were: 22% healthy, 23%
      had mobility disability, 26% had major disease, and 29% died. Relative to those
      with high total PA, the adjusted odds ratios (OR) (confidence intervals [CI]) for
      mobility disability was 1.6 (1.4–1.7), 1.2 (1.1–1.3), and 1.1 (1.0–1.2) for women
      with no, low, and moderate total PA, respectively (p-trend < .001). The
      corresponding covariate-adjusted OR (CI) for mortality was 1.7 (1.5–1.8), 1.2
      (1.1–1.3), and 1.0 (1.0–1.1) (p-trend < .001). Total PA was not associated with
      developing chronic disease before age 85 years. Sitting ≥10 relative to <5 hours 
      per day increased the odds of mobility disability (1.1, CI: 1.0–1.3) and
      mortality (1.2, CI: 1.0–1.3) prior to age 85 years (p < .001). Conclusions:
      Increasing PA to recommended levels and reducing sitting time are modifiable
      behaviors that may improve healthy aging in older women.

PG  - 21S-37S
AB  - Objective:: To evaluate perceptions of participants in the Qualitative Interview 
      Study (an add-on to the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD) about frequent use
      and reasons for substance use (SU). Method:: Longitudinal assessments identified 
      39 ADHD cases and 19 peers with Persistent SU, and 86 ADHD cases and 39 peers
      without Persistent SU. In adulthood, an open-ended interview was administered,
      and SU excerpts were indexed and classified to create sub-topics (Frequent use
      and Reasons for use and non-use of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs).
      Results:: For marijuana, the Persistent compared to Non-Persistent SU group had a
      significantly higher percentage of participants describing frequent use and
      giving reasons for use, and the ADHD compared to the peer group had a
      significantly higher percentage giving “stability” as a reason for use.
      Conclusion:: Motivations for persistent marijuana use may differ for adults with 
      and without a history of ADHD in childhood.

TI  - Estimating multiple time-fixed treatment effects using a semi-Bayes
      semiparametric marginal structural Cox proportional hazards regression model.
PG  - 100-14
AB  - Marginal structural models for time-fixed treatments fit using
      inverse-probability weighted estimating equations are increasingly popular.
      Nonetheless, the resulting effect estimates are subject to finite-sample bias
      when data are sparse, as is typical for large-sample procedures. Here we propose 
      a semi-Bayes estimation approach which penalizes or shrinks the estimated model
      parameters to improve finite-sample performance. This approach uses simple
      symmetric data-augmentation priors. Limited simulation experiments indicate that 
      the proposed approach reduces finite-sample bias and improves confidence-interval
      coverage when the true values lie within the central “hill” of the prior
      distribution. We illustrate the approach with data from a nonexperimental study
      of HIV treatments.

TI  - Wild Mouse Gut Microbiota Promotes Host Fitness and Improves Disease Resistance.
PG  - 1015-1028.e13
AB  - Laboratory mice, while paramount for understanding basic biological phenomena,
      are limited in modeling complex diseases of humans and other free-living mammals.
      Because the microbiome is a major factor in mammalian physiology, we aimed to
      identify a naturally evolved reference microbiome to better recapitulate
      physiological phenomena relevant in the natural world outside the laboratory.
      Among 21 distinct mouse populations worldwide we identified a closely related
      wild relative to standard laboratory mouse strains. Its bacterial gut microbiome 
      differed significantly from its laboratory mouse counterpart, and was transferred
      to and maintained in laboratory mice over several generations. Laboratory mice
      reconstituted with natural microbiota exhibited reduced inflammation and
      increased survival following influenza virus infection, and improved resistance
      against mutagen/inflammation-induced colorectal tumorigenesis. By demonstrating
      the host fitness-promoting traits of natural microbiota, our findings should
      enable the discovery of protective mechanisms relevant in the natural world and
      improve the modeling of complex diseases of free-living mammals.

TI  - Adverse Life Events, Psychiatric History, and Biological Predictors of Postpartum
      Depression in an Ethnically Diverse Sample of Postpartum Women.
PG  - 1190-200
AB  - Background:: Race, psychiatric history, and adverse life events have all been
      independently associated with postpartum depression (PPD). However, the role
      these play together in Black and Latina women remains inadequately studied.
      Therefore, we performed a case-control study of PPD, including comprehensive
      assessments of symptoms and biomarkers, while examining the effects of genetic
      ancestry. Methods:: We recruited our sample (549 cases, 968 controls) at six
      weeks postpartum from obstetrical clinics in North Carolina. PPD status was
      determined using the MINI-plus. Psychiatric history was extracted from medical
      records. Participants were administered self-report instruments to assess
      depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and adverse life events. Levels
      of estradiol, progesterone, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), oxytocin,
      and allopregnanalone were assayed. Principal components from genotype data were
      used to estimate genetic ancestry and logistic regression was used to identify
      predictors of PPD. Results:: This population was racially diverse (68% Black, 13%
      Latina, 18% European). Genetic ancestry was not a predictor of PPD. Case status
      was predicted by a history of major depression (p = 4.01E-14), lifetime anxiety
      disorder diagnosis (p = 1.25E-34), and adverse life events (p = 6.06E-06). There 
      were no significant differences between groups in any hormones or neurosteroids. 
      Conclusions:: Psychiatric history and multiple exposures to adverse life events
      were significant predictors of PPD in a population of minority and low-income
      women. Genetic ancestry and hormone levels were not predictive of case status.
      Increased genetic vulnerability in conjunction with risk factors may predict the 
      onset of PPD, whereas genetic ancestry does not appear predictive.

TI  - Public Knowledge and Credibility Perceptions of the FDA as a Tobacco Regulator.
PG  - 1310-6
AB  - Introduction: Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was granted
      regulatory authority over tobacco products in 2009, few studies have examined
      perceived credibility of the FDA in this role. The current study assessed
      knowledge and credibility of the FDA as a regulator of tobacco products. Methods:
      In a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults (N = 4758), we assessed
      knowledge that the FDA regulates the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of 
      cigarettes, and credibility of the FDA as a tobacco regulator. We examined
      demographic differences in knowledge and credibility, and associations of
      knowledge and trust in government with credibility perceptions. Results: Less
      than half of respondents reported knowing the FDA regulates how cigarettes are
      sold (46.8%) and advertised (49.7%), and only 36.0% knew the FDA regulates how
      cigarettes are made, with few demographic differences. Respondents reported that 
      the FDA was moderately credible in regulating tobacco. Knowledge of the FDA as a 
      tobacco regulator and trust in government were the strongest predictors of
      credibility. Being of younger age, being White (compared to African American),
      and being male were associated with higher credibility ratings of the FDA.
      Conclusions: Much of the public still does not know that the FDA regulates
      tobacco products, and credibility perceptions are moderate. Greater knowledge of 
      the FDA’s regulatory role was associated with higher credibility; efforts that
      increase the public’s understanding of the FDA’s role as a tobacco regulator may 
      positively impact views of the agency’s credibility. This may in turn improve
      public reception to the FDA’s messages and regulations. Implications: This study 
      is the first to show nationally representative estimates of both knowledge and
      credibility of the FDA as a tobacco regulator. Our research shows further that
      knowledge of the FDA’s tobacco regulatory roles is likely to be an important
      factor related to perceived credibility of the FDA. Increasing the public’s
      knowledge of the FDA’s roles may enhance the agency’s credibility, which can
      improve public reception to messages and regulations.

TI  - Neratinib Efficacy and Circulating Tumor DNA Detection of HER2 Mutations in HER2 
      Nonamplified Metastatic Breast Cancer.
PG  - 5687-95
AB  - Purpose:: Based on promising predinical data, we conducted a single-arm phase II 
      trial to assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of neratinib, defined as
      complete/partial response (CR/PR) or stable disease (SD) ≥24 weeks, in HER2mut
      nonamplified metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Secondary endpoints included
      progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
      HER2mut detection. Experimental Design:: Tumor tissue positive for HER2mut was
      required for eligibility. Neratinib was administered 240 mg daily with
      prophylactic loperamide. ctDNA sequencing was performed retrospectively for 54
      patients (14 positive and 40 negative for tumor HER2mut). Results:: Nine of 381
      tumors (2.4%) sequenced centrally harbored HER2mut (lobular 7.8% vs. ductal 1.6%;
      P = 0.026). Thirteen additional HER2mut cases were identified locally. Twenty-one
      of these 22 HER2mut cases were estrogen receptor positive. Sixteen patients
      [median age 58 (31–74) years and three (2–10) prior metastatic regimens] received
      neratinib. The CBR was 31% [90% confidence interval (CI),13%–55%], including one 
      CR, one PR, and three SD ≥24 weeks. Median PFS was 16 (90% CI, 8–31) weeks.
      Diarrhea (grade 2, 44%; grade 3, 25%) was the most common adverse event. Baseline
      ctDNA sequencing identified the same HER2mut in 11 of 14 tumor-positive cases
      (sensitivity, 79%; 90% CI, 53%–94%) and correctly assigned 32 of 32 informative
      negative cases (specificity, 100%; 90% CI, 91%–100%). In addition, ctDNA HER2mut 
      variant allele frequency decreased in nine of 11 paired samples at week 4,
      followed by an increase upon progression. Conclusions:: Neratinib is active in
      HER2mut, nonamplified MBC. ctDNA sequencing offers a noninvasive strategy to
      identify patients with HER2mut cancers for clinical trial participation.

TI  - Comparison of Sampling Strategies for Tobacco Retailer Inspections to Maximize
      Coverage in Vulnerable Areas and Minimize Cost.
PG  - 1353-8
AB  - Introduction: In the United States, tens of thousands of inspections of tobacco
      retailers are conducted each year. Various sampling choices can reduce travel
      costs, emphasize enforcement in areas with greater noncompliance, and allow for
      comparability between states and over time. We sought to develop a model sampling
      strategy for state tobacco retailer inspections. Methods: Using a 2014 list of
      10,161 North Carolina tobacco retailers, we compared results from simple random
      sampling; stratified, clustered at the ZIP code sampling; and, stratified,
      clustered at the census tract sampling. We conducted a simulation of repeated
      sampling and compared approaches for their comparative level of precision,
      coverage, and retailer dispersion. Results: While maintaining an adequate design 
      effect and statistical precision appropriate for a public health enforcement
      program, both stratified, clustered ZIP- and tract-based approaches were
      feasible. Both ZIP and tract strategies yielded improvements over simple random
      sampling, with relative improvements, respectively, of average distance between
      retailers (reduced 5.0% and 1.9%), percent Black residents in sampled
      neighborhoods (increased 17.2% and 32.6%), percent Hispanic residents in sampled 
      neighborhoods (reduced 2.2% and increased 18.3%), percentage of sampled retailers
      located near schools (increased 61.3% and 37.5%), and poverty rate in sampled
      neighborhoods (increased 14.0% and 38.2%). Conclusions: States can make retailer 
      inspections more efficient and targeted with stratified, clustered sampling. Use 
      of statistically appropriate sampling strategies like these should be considered 
      by states, researchers, and the Food and Drug Administration to improve program
      impact and allow for comparisons over time and across states. Implications: The
      authors present a model tobacco retailer sampling strategy for promoting
      compliance and reducing costs that could be used by US states and the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA). The design is feasible to implement in North Carolina.
      Use of the sampling design would help document the impact of FDA’s compliance and
      enforcement program, save money, and emphasize inspections in areas where they
      are needed most. FDA should consider requiring probability-based sampling in
      their inspections contracts with states and private contractors.

TI  - Analyzing Unstructured Communication in a Computer-Mediated Environment for
      Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Research Protocol.
LID - e65
AB  - Background: Individuals with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk for
      comorbidities such as heart disease, lower limb amputations, stroke, and renal
      failure. Multiple factors influence development of complications in a person
      living with type 2 diabetes; however, an individual’s self-management behaviors
      may delay the onset of, or lessen the severity of, these complications. Social
      support provides personal, informal advice and knowledge that helps individuals
      initiate and sustain self-management and adherence. Objective: Our aim was to
      gain an understanding of type 2 diabetes social interaction in a virtual
      environment, one type of computer-mediated environment (CME), and the social
      support characteristics that increase and sustain self-management in adults
      living with chronic illness. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of
      longitudinal data collected in a CME study, Second Life Impacts Diabetes
      Education & Self-Management (1R21-LM010727-01). This virtual environment
      replicated a real-life community where 6 months of naturalistic synchronous voice
      conversations, emails, and text chats were recorded among participants and
      providers. This analysis uses a mixed-methods approach to explore and compare
      qualitative and quantitative findings. This analysis is guided by two theories:
      Strong/Weak Ties Theory and Social Penetration Theory. Qualitative data will be
      analyzed using content analysis, and we will complete descriptive statistics on
      the quantified variables (eg, average number of ties). Institutional review board
      approval was obtained in June 2016. Results: This study is in progress.
      Conclusions: Interventions provided through virtual environments are a promising 
      solution to increasing self-management practices. However, little is known of the
      depth, breadth, and quality of social support that is exchanged and how
      interaction supports self-management and relates to health outcomes. This study
      will provide knowledge that will help guide clinical practice and policy to
      enhance social support for chronic illness via the Internet.

TI  - Robot-assisted versus open radical cystectomy in patients receiving perioperative
      chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer: the oncologists’ perspective
      from a multicentre study.
PG  - 937-45
AB  - Background: Little is known about the outcomes of robot-assisted radical
      cystectomy (RARC) compared to open radical cystectomy (ORC) combined with
      perioperative chemotherapy for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer (UBC).
      Objective: We aimed to evaluate the surgical and oncological outcomes of two
      cystectomy approaches in multimodal treatment. Design, Setting, Participants:
      Data from 28 centres were collected for cystectomies performed between January
      2000 and July 2013. Intervention: RARC or ORC combined with perioperative
      chemotherapy for UBC. Outcome measures and statistical analysis: Fisher’s exact
      tests, χ2 tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare the RARC or ORC
      groups. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate potential
      prognostic factors. Results and limitations: A total of 688 patients (n=603 ORC
      and n=85 RARC) were analysed; 60.6% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 45.1% 
      adjuvant chemotherapy. No significant difference was found in the baseline
      characteristics between the surgical groups. Median time from surgery to adjuvant
      chemotherapy was 1.9 months for both RARC and ORC groups. The median
      (interquartile range, IQR) number of removed lymph nodes was 21 (14–35) with RARC
      and 13 (8–21) with ORC (p<0.001); results were confirmed in subgroup analyses. No
      difference was found in multivariable analyses in the rate of positive surgical
      margins (p=0.54 and p=0.78), rate of neobladder diversion (p=0.33 and p=0.51),
      relapse-free survival (p=0.31 and p=0.23), and overall survival (p=0.63 and
      p=0.69). The retrospective nature of the data was the major limitation.
      Conclusions: In this study, no differences in efficacy outcomes or ability to
      deliver adjuvant chemotherapy were observed between RARC and ORC. The increasing 
      use of RARC is justifiable from an oncological viewpoint. Patient summary: In a
      retrospective study of patients who received perioperative chemotherapy for UBC, 
      we found no difference in key outcomes between RARC and ORC. Performing RARC
      seems to be justifiable in the multidisciplinary setting.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of Perioperative Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced
      Penile Squamous-Cell Carcinoma: Results of a Multicenter Analysis.
PG  - 548-555.e3
AB  - Patients with locally advanced penile squamous-cell carcinoma have a poor
      prognosis. No difference in survival was noted when using chemotherapy before or 
      after surgery. Uncertainties persist regarding the optimal management of these
      patients, and new treatments are urgently required, particularly for patients at 
      highest risk, with bilateral and/or pelvic lymph node involvement.Background::
      The prognosis of patients with locally advanced penile squamous-cell carcinoma is
      primarily related to the extent of lymph node metastases. Surgery alone yields
      suboptimal results, and there is a paucity of data on these patients’ outcomes.
      Patients and Methods:: This retrospective study evaluated patients who received
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy from 1990 onward at 12 centers. Cox models
      were used to investigate prognostic factors for relapse-free survival and overall
      survival (OS). Results:: Among the 201 included patients, 39 (19.4%) had disease 
      of T3-4 and N0 clinical stage; the remaining patients had clinical lymph node
      involvement (cN+). Ninety-four patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (group 
      1), 78 received adjuvant chemotherapy (group 2), and 21 received both (group 3). 
      Eight patients for whom the timing of perioperative chemotherapy administration
      was unavailable were included in the Cox analyses. Forty-three patients (21.4%)
      received chemoradiation. Multivariate analysis for OS (n = 172) revealed
      bilateral disease (P = .035) as a negative prognostic factor, while pelvic cN+
      tended to be nonsignificantly associated with decreased OS (P = .076). One-year
      relapse-free survival was 35.6%, 60.6%, and 45.1% in the 3 groups, respectively. 
      One-year OS was 61.3%, 82.2%, and 75%, respectively. No significant differences
      were seen on univariable analyses for OS between the groups (P = .45). Platinum
      type of chemotherapy and chemoradiation were not significantly associated with
      any outcome analyzed. Conclusion:: Benchmark survival estimates for patients
      receiving perioperative chemotherapy for locally advanced penile squamous-cell
      carcinoma have been provided, with no substantial differences observed between
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant administration. This analysis may result in improved
      patient information, although prospective studies are warranted.

      Research Design and Methods: This analysis included 2,994 adult participants ages
      18–74 with diabetes from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos
      (HCHS/SOL—2008–2011). Select items from the Social Network Inventory (SNI) were
      used to assess indices of structural social support, i.e., network size (number
      of children, parents, and in-laws) and frequency of familial contact.
      Standardized methods were used to measure abdominal obesity, BMI, hypertension,
      hypercholesterolemia, and smoking status. Multivariate regression was used to
      examine associations of structural support with individual CVD risk factors with 
      demographics, acculturation, physical health, and psychological ill-being
      (depressive symptoms and anxiety) included as covariates. Results: There were no 
      significant cross-sectional associations of structural support indices with
      abdominal obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking status. There
      was a marginally significant (OR: 1.05; 95%CI 0.99–1.11) trend toward higher odds
      of obesity in participants reporting a larger family unit (including children,
      parents, and in-laws) and those with closer ties with extended family relatives
      (OR: 1.04; 95%CI 0.99–1.09). Conclusions: Structural social support was
      marginally associated with higher odds of obesity in Hispanic/Latino adults with 
      diabetes. Alternate forms of social support (e.g., healthcare professionals,
      friends, peers) should be further explored as potential markers of cardiac risk
      in Hispanics/Latinos with diabetes.

TI  - Patient, Provider, and Combined Interventions for Managing Osteoarthritis in
      Primary Care: A Cluster Randomized Trial.
PG  - 401-11
AB  - Background:: A single-site study showed that a combined patient and provider
      intervention improved outcomes for patients with knee osteoarthritis, but it did 
      not assess separate effects of the interventions. Objective:: To examine whether 
      patient-based, provider-based, and patient-provider interventions improve
      osteoarthritis outcomes. Design:: Cluster randomized trial with assignment to
      patient, provider, and patient-provider interventions or usual care.
      (ClinicalTrials.gov: ) Setting:: 10 Duke University Health System community-based
      primary care clinics. Participants:: 537 outpatients with symptomatic hip or knee
      osteoarthritis. Intervention:: The telephone-based patient intervention focused
      on weight management, physical activity, and cognitive behavioral pain
      management. The provider intervention involved electronic delivery of
      patient-specific osteoarthritis treatment recommendations to providers.
      Measurements:: The primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score at 12 months. Secondary
      outcomes were objective physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery)
      and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire). Linear mixed models
      assessed the difference in improvement among groups. Results:: No difference was 
      observed in WOMAC score changes from baseline to 12 months in the patient ( –1.5 
      [95% CI, –5.1 to 2.0]; P = 0.40), provider (2.5 [CI, –0.9 to 5.9]; P = 0.152), or
      patient-provider ( –0.7 [CI, –4.2 to 2.8]; P = 0.69) intervention groups compared
      with usual care. All groups had improvements in WOMAC scores at 12 months (range,
      –3.7 to –7.7). In addition, no differences were seen in objective physical
      function or depressive symptoms at 12 months in any of the intervention groups
      compared with usual care. Limitations:: The study involved 1 health care network.
      Data on provider referrals were not collected. Conclusion:: Contrary to a
      previous study of a combined patient and provider intervention for osteoarthritis
      in a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center, this study found no
      statistically significant improvements in the osteoarthritis intervention groups 
      compared with usual care. Primary Funding Source:: National Institute of
      Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.

TI  - Community Extraction in Multilayer Networks with Heterogeneous Community
      Structure.
PG  - 5458-506
AB  - Multilayer networks are a useful way to capture and model multiple, binary or
      weighted relationships among a fixed group of objects. While community detection 
      has proven to be a useful exploratory technique for the analysis of single-layer 
      networks, the development of community detection methods for multilayer networks 
      is still in its infancy. We propose and investigate a procedure, called
      Multilayer Extraction, that identifies densely connected vertex-layer sets in
      multilayer networks. Multilayer Extraction makes use of a significance based
      score that quantifies the connectivity of an observed vertex-layer set through
      comparison with a fixed degree random graph model. Multilayer Extraction directly
      handles networks with heterogeneous layers where community structure may be
      different from layer to layer. The procedure can capture overlapping communities,
      as well as background vertex-layer pairs that do not belong to any community. We 
      establish consistency of the vertex-layer set optimizer of our proposed
      multilayer score under the multilayer stochastic block model. We investigate the 
      performance of Multilayer Extraction on three applications and a test bed of
      simulations. Our theoretical and numerical evaluations suggest that Multilayer
      Extraction is an effective exploratory tool for analyzing complex multilayer
      networks. Publicly available code is available at
      https://github.com/jdwilson4/MultilayerExtraction.

TI  - Antianginal medications and long‐term outcomes after elective catheterization in 
      patients with coronary artery disease.
PG  - 721-7
AB  - Background: Antianginal medications are a class I recommendation by the American 
      College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for stable ischemic
      heart disease. We sought to better understand guidance in drug selection and
      real‐life outcomes of antianginal medication use. Hypothesis: In patients with
      stable ischemic heart disease, antianginal medications lower mortality. Methods: 
      We evaluated 5608 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on
      elective cardiac catheterization with follow‐up through self‐administered
      questionnaires. Patients were classified as being prescribed a particular
      medication if they received that medication at index catheterization, or within 3
      months postcatheterization. The association between antianginal medication use
      and outcomes was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results:
      Compared with the 11% not prescribed any antianginal medication, patients
      prescribed antianginal medication were more likely to be older and female; have a
      history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, or
      3‐vessel CAD; have lower adjusted mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.75, 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.63‐0.89); and experience mortality or myocardial
      infarction (HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.71‐0.98). Compared with patients not taking
      β‐blockers (17%), those taking β‐blockers had a lower risk of mortality (HR:
      0.76, 95% CI: 0.66‐0.88). Patients prescribed calcium channel blockers or
      long‐acting nitrates had a higher risk of mortality compared with nonusers (HR:
      1.16, 95% CI: 1.04‐1.29; HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08‐1.34; respectively). Conclusions:
      Antianginal medications are not universally prescribed among obstructive CAD
      patients; nonuse was associated with higher mortality. For CAD patients with or
      without prior myocardial infarction, β‐blockers were associated with improved
      long‐term survival.

TI  - A multi-centre evaluation of eleven clinically feasible brain PET/MRI attenuation
      correction techniques using a large cohort of patients.
PG  - 346-59
AB  - Aim:: To accurately quantify the radioactivity concentration measured by PET,
      emission data need to be corrected for photon attenuation; however, the MRI
      signal cannot easily be converted into attenuation values, making attenuation
      correction (AC) in PET/MRI challenging. In order to further improve the current
      vendor-implemented MR-AC methods for absolute quantification, a number of
      prototype methods have been proposed in the literature. These can be categorized 
      into three types: template/atlas-based, segmentation-based, and
      reconstruction-based. These proposed methods in general demonstrated improvements
      compared to vendor-implemented AC, and many studies report deviations in PET
      uptake after AC of only a few percent from a gold standard CT-AC. Using a unified
      quantitative evaluation with identical metrics, subject cohort, and common
      CT-based reference, the aims of this study were to evaluate a selection of novel 
      methods proposed in the literature, and identify the ones suitable for clinical
      use. Methods:: In total, 11 AC methods were evaluated: two vendor-implemented
      (MR-ACDIXON and MR-ACUTE), five based on template/atlas information (MR-ACSEGBONE
      (Koesters et al., 2016), MR-ACONTARIO (Anazodo et al., 2014), MR-ACBOSTON
      (Izquierdo-Garcia et al., 2014), MR-ACUCL (Burgos et al., 2014), and MR-ACMAXPROB
      (Merida et al., 2015)), one based on simultaneous reconstruction of attenuation
      and emission (MR-ACMLAA (Benoit et al., 2015)), and three based on
      image-segmentation (MR-ACMUNICH (Cabello et al., 2015), MR-ACCAR-RiDR (Juttukonda
      et al., 2015), and MR-ACRESOLUTE (Ladefoged et al., 2015)). We selected 359
      subjects who were scanned using one of the following radiotracers: [18F]FDG
      (210), [11C]PiB (51), and [18F] florbetapir (98). The comparison to AC with a
      gold standard CT was performed both globally and regionally, with a special focus
      on robustness and outlier analysis. Results:: The average performance in PET
      tracer uptake was within ± 5% of CT for all of the proposed methods, with the
      average ± SD global percentage bias in PET FDG uptake for each method being:
      MR-ACDIXON (−11.3 ± 3.5)%, MR-ACUTE (−5.7 ± 2.0)%, MR-ACONTARIO (−4.3 ± 3.6)%,
      MR-ACMUNICH (3.7 ± 2.1)%, MR-ACMLAA (−1.9 ± 2.6)%, MR-ACSEGBONE (−1.7 ± 3.6)%,
      MR-ACUCL (0.8 ± 1.2)%, MR-ACCAR-RiDR (−0.4 ± 1.9)%, MR-ACMAXPROB (−0.4 ± 1.6)%,
      MR-ACBOSTON (−0.3 ± 1.8)%, and MR-ACRESOLUTE (0.3 ± 1.7)%, ordered by average
      bias. The overall best performing methods (MR-ACBOSTON, MR-ACMAXPROB,
      MR-ACRESOLUTE and MR-ACUCL, ordered alphabetically) showed regional average
      errors within ± 3% of PET with CT-AC in all regions of the brain with FDG, and
      the same four methods, as well as MR-ACCAR-RiDR, showed that for 95% of the
      patients, 95% of brain voxels had an uptake that deviated by less than 15% from
      the reference. Comparable performance was obtained with PiB and florbetapir.
      Conclusions:: All of the proposed novel methods have an average global
      performance within likely acceptable limits ( ± 5% of CT-based reference), and
      the main difference among the methods was found in the robustness, outlier
      analysis, and clinical feasibility. Overall, the best performing methods were
      MR-ACBOSTON, MR-ACMAXPROB, MR-ACRESOLUTE and MR-ACUCL, ordered alphabetically.
      These methods all minimized the number of outliers, standard deviation, and
      average global and local error. The methods MR-ACMUNICH and MR-ACCAR-RiDR were
      both within acceptable quantitative limits, so these methods should be considered
      if processing time is a factor. The method MR-ACSEGBONE also demonstrates
      promising results, and performs well within the likely acceptable quantitative
      limits. For clinical routine scans where processing time can be a key factor,
      this vendor-provided solution currently outperforms most methods. With the
      performance of the methods presented here, it may be concluded that the challenge
      of improving the accuracy of MR-AC in adult brains with normal anatomy has been
      solved to a quantitatively acceptable degree, which is smaller than the
      quantification reproducibility in PET imaging.

TI  - Risk of Advanced Neoplasia Using the National Cancer Institute’s Colorectal
      Cancer Risk Assessment Tool.
LID - djw181
AB  - Background: There is no validated, discriminating, and easy-to-apply tool for
      estimating risk of colorectal neoplasia. We studied whether the National Cancer
      Institute’s (NCI’s) Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Risk Assessment Tool, which estimates
      future CRC risk, could estimate current risk for advanced colorectal neoplasia
      among average-risk persons.Methods: This cross-sectional study involved
      individuals age 50 to 80 years undergoing first-time screening colonoscopy. We
      measured medical and family history, lifestyle information, and physical measures
      and calculated each person’s future CRC risk using the NCI tool’s logistic
      regression equation. We related quintiles of future CRC risk to the current risk 
      of advanced neoplasia (sessile serrated polyp or tubular adenoma ≥ 1 cm, a polyp 
      with villous histology or high-grade dysplasia, or CRC). All statistical tests
      were two-sided.Results: For 4457 (98.5%) with complete data (mean age = 57.2
      years, SD = 6.6 years, 51.7% women), advanced neoplasia prevalence was 8.26%.
      Based on quintiles of five-year estimated absolute CRC risk, current risks of
      advanced neoplasia were 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3% to 3.3%), 4.8% 
      (95% CI = 3.5% to 6.4%), 6.4% (95% CI = 4.9% to 8.2%), 10.0% (95% CI = 8.1% to
      12.1%), and 17.6% (95% CI = 15.5% to 20.6%; P < .001). For quintiles of estimated
      10-year CRC risk, corresponding current risks for advanced neoplasia were 2.2%
      (95% CI = 1.4% to 3.5%), 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5% to 6.4%), 6.5% (95% CI = 5.0% to
      8.3%), 9.3% (95% CI = 7.5% to 11.4%), and 18.4% (95% CI = 15.9% to 21.1%; P <
      .001). Among persons with an estimated five-year CRC risk above the median,
      current risk for advanced neoplasia was 12.8%, compared with 3.7% among those
      below the median (relative risk = 3.4, 95 CI = 2.7 to 4.4).Conclusions: The NCI’s
      Risk Assessment Tool, which estimates future CRC risk, may be used to estimate
      current risk for advanced neoplasia, making it potentially useful for tailoring
      and improving CRC screening efficiency among average-risk persons.

TI  - What is included with your online e-cigarette order? An analysis of e-cigarette
      shipping, product and packaging features.
PG  - 699-702
AB  - Background: The electronic cigarette industry is growing, with youth using
      e-cigarettes at higher rates than they are using cigarettes, and retail and
      online sales projected to reach $10 billion in 2017. Minimal regulation of the
      production and marketing of e-cigarettes exists to date, which has allowed
      companies to promote unsupported claims. We assessed the shipping, product
      features and packaging of a wide variety of e-cigarettes purchased online by
      adults and youth. Methods: The most popular internet e-cigarette vendors were
      identified from a larger study of internet tobacco vendors. Between August 2013
      and June 2014, adults made 56 purchase attempts from online vendors, and youth
      made 98 attempts. Packages received were assessed for exterior and internal
      packaging features, including product information, health warnings and additional
      materials. Results: We analysed a total of 125 orders featuring 86 unique brands 
      of e-cigarettes. The contents were rarely indicated on package exteriors. Product
      information came with just 60% of orders and just 38.4% included an instruction
      manual. Only 44.6% of products included a health warning, and some had
      unsupported claims, such as lack of secondhand smoke exposure. Additionally, some
      products were leaking e-liquid and battery fluid on arrival. Conclusions: A large
      variety of e-cigarette products are manufactured and marketed to consumers. Many 
      products do not include instructions for use, and unsupported claims are being
      presented to consumers. Effective federal regulation of the manufacturing,
      packaging, product information and health claims surrounding e-cigarettes is
      necessary to ensure consumers are presented with accurate e-cigarette use
      information.

TI  - Patients with primary membranous nephropathy are at high risk of cardiovascular
      events.
PG  - 1111-8
AB  - Here we conducted a retrospective study to examine the risk of cardiovascular
      events (CVEs) relative to that of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with
      primary membranous nephropathy, in a discovery cohort of 404 patients. The
      cumulative incidence of CVEs was estimated in the setting of the competing risk
      of ESRD with risk factors for CVEs assessed by multivariable survival analysis.
      The observed cumulative incidences of CVEs were 4.4%, 5.4%, 8.2%, and 8.8% at 1, 
      2, 3, and 5 years respectively in the primary membranous nephropathy cohort. In
      the first 2 years after diagnosis, the risk for CVEs was similar to that of ESRD 
      in the entire cohort, but exceeded it among patients with preserved renal
      function. Accounting for traditional risk factors and renal function, the
      severity of nephrosis at the time of the event (hazard ratio 2.1, 95% confidence 
      interval 1.1 to 4.3) was a significant independent risk factor of CVEs. The
      incidence and risk factors of CVEs were affirmed in an external validation cohort
      of 557 patients with primary membranous nephropathy. Thus early in the course of 
      disease, patients with primary membranous nephropathy have an increased risk of
      CVEs commensurate to, or exceeding that of ESRD. Hence, reduction of CVEs should 
      be considered as a therapeutic outcome measure and focus of intervention in
      primary membranous nephropathy.

TI  - Topography Influences Adherent Cell Regulation of Osteoclastogenesis.
PG  - 319-26
AB  - The importance of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in the process of
      osseointegration has not been widely considered. In this study, cell culture was 
      used to investigate the hypothesis that the function of implant-adherent bone
      marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in osteoclastogenesis is influenced by surface
      topography. BMSCs isolated from femur and tibia of Sprague-Dawley rats were
      seeded onto 3 types of titanium surfaces (smooth, micro, and nano) and a control 
      surface (tissue culture plastic) with or without osteogenic supplements. After 3 
      to 14 d, conditioned medium (CM) was collected. Subsequently, rat bone
      marrow–derived macrophages (BMMs) were cultured in media supplemented with
      soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) as well as BMSC CM from each of the 4 surfaces.
      Gene expression levels of soluble RANKL, osteoprotegerin, tumor necrosis factor
      α, and M-CSF in cultured BMSCs at different time points were measured by
      real-time polymerase chain reaction. The number of differentiated osteoclastic
      cells was determined after tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Analysis
      of variance and t test were used for statistical analysis. The expression of
      prominent osteoclast-promoting factors tumor necrosis factor α and M-CSF was
      increased by BMSCs cultured on both micro- and nanoscale titanium topographies (P
      < 0.01). BMSC CM contained a heat-labile factor that increased BMMs
      osteoclastogenesis. CM from both micro- and nanoscale surface-adherent BMSCs
      increased the osteoclast number (P < 0.01). Difference in surface topography
      altered BMSC phenotype and influenced BMM osteoclastogenesis. Local signaling by 
      implant-adherent cells at the implant-bone interface may indirectly control
      osteoclastogenesis and bone accrual around endosseous implants.
